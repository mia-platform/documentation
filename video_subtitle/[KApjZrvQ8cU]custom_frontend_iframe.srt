Hi everyone and welcome to the Mia-Platform
tutorials. Today we're going to take a look at

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:13,560
Custom frontend as an IFrame. What is an IFrame?
An IFrame is a simple way to embed a web page or

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:19,960
a web component in another web page or another web
component. The most common use of an IFrame is to

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:26,240
load content from another page into another site
within the page. The child site can load its own

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,240
content and cookies so sites may allow it where
they don't allow direct hot linking content. Using

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,600
an IFrame is the accepted way to embed a YouTube
video or a Google Maps content into your web

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:45,160
page. We brought this concept to our Mia-Platform
Console. Since our Console is a tool born to embed

8
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,520
other Cloud Native tools, we have an interface
where you can configure more advanced features

9
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:57,000
and our users can directly access a different
interface within the console. For this example,

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,440
let's imagine that you are someone who uses
Backstage and the Mia-Platform Console on a

11
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,200
regular working day. In this video we will enter
the Core Enterprise Platform section in our

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,880
companies and we will go to the Backstage icon. As
you can see, here you have the Mia-Platform demo

13
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,360
Backstage app within the Mia-Platform Console
itself. Here you can enter as a guest user and

14
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,960
carry out with your proceedings. As you can see
this is a super easy way for you to integrate

15
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,640
another web page into the Mia-Platform Console.
We hope this was helpful and as always if you have

16
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:41,320
any questions feel free to reach out to us or book
a demo on the Mia-Platform website. Thank you!
