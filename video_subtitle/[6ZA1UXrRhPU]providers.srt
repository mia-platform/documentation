Hi, and welcome to Mia-Platform
Video Pills.

2
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:08,008
Today we will see

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:11,978
a new way of managing providers in 
Mia-Platform Console at the platform level.

4
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,813
Providers can be generically defined

5
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:16,850
as a means of storing information
about external services.

6
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:20,820
Starting on the page that contains all
your projects, click on Platform Overview.

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,223
The Providers tab is located on the left
sidebar.

8
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:25,525
On this page, you have the list of providers.

9
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:29,129
You can see that we already created
Mia-Platform, GitLab and Azure DevOps.

10
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:32,932
Each provider is listed with the type
of capacity and service used.

11
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,235
Let's try to add a new one.

12
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:36,870
Click on Add Provider Connection.

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,638
A modal window is displayed.

14
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:40,707
You can choose from a range of providers.

15
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,142
Click on Get Lab.

16
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:45,278
On the next page we can select
the features used by the provider,

17
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:49,349
the secret manager, the get provider,
the CI/CD tool for all of them.

18
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,086
Next, you enter the name of the provider,

19
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:56,790
the basic API URL and a brief description
if necessary.

20
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:02,896
Following the wizard,
we can now enter the credentials.

21
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:04,864
On the last page,

22
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:06,032
in the Advanced section,

23
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:09,235
we can enter a Certificate Authority
and the proxy if required.

24
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,671
Let's add
the provider and close the modal.

25
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:14,507
We now find our new GitLab
provider in the list.

26
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,011
If you need to change it, just
click on the arrow and 

27
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:20,380
edit the field you want to modify.

28
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,352
With this feature,
you can manage providers from one place,

29
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:30,523
defining their capabilities, entering
credentials, certifications, authority

30
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,625
and proxies.
