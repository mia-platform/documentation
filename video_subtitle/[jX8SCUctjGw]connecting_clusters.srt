Hi everyone and welcome to the Mia-Platform tutorials! Today we're going to see how you can  

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:11,000
add a cluster connection with existing clusters in the Mia-Platform Console. To begin with,  

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,560
we're in the Experiment section of the Mia-Platform Console. Let's go ahead and  

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:22,040
click on "Clusters". Here you can see the existing clusters that already exist in your project and  

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:27,200
you can see how to add a cluster connection. As you can see we have two existing clusters,  

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,160
a noprod and an rke. If you click on the arrow here, you'll be able to see all of the information  

7
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,600
about them. Let's go ahead and add a cluster connection. So as you can see we have multiple  

8
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:46,760
Cloud providers for you to create a new cluster connection: we have GCP, AWS, Azure, Oracle Cloud,  

9
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:53,480
and you can also use any other Cloud Provider. For this example, let's go ahead and use GCP. As you  

10
00:00:53,480 --> 00:01:01,400
can see there are four available runtime services: GKE, Autopilot, Kubernetes and OpenShift. For this  

11
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,600
example, let's go ahead and use Kubernetes. This is your new cluster, which is provided by  

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:16,400
GCP with Kurnetes as the runtime service. For the example, let's go ahead and put in a cluster ID.

13
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,640
Then let's put in an a URL

14
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:26,760
and then we insert the geographics. For this example, let's just put in the UK. Then you  

15
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:36,160
can add a description. Let's go ahead and click on "Next". Then you add your service account token:  

16
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:43,040
for this example I'm just adding a dummy text. In this stage you can add a Certificate authority or  

17
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,480
a Proxy. To add them you simply click on "Add" and put in the Certificate authority. You can do the  

18
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:54,040
same for the proxy. Once you're happy with this you can go ahead and click on "Add cluster" and  

19
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,760
with this your new cluster connection will be complete. Thank you for watching and as usual,
