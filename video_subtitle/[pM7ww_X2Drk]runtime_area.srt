Hi and welcome to Mia-Platform Video Pills

2
00:00:02,833 --> 00:00:05,366
Today I will show how we have enriched
the runtime area,

3
00:00:05,366 --> 00:00:09,133
providing it with an extended sidebar
with new tabs for monitoring workloads.

4
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:11,099
Let's begin.

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:14,099
Once on the project homepage
access the runtime area.

6
00:00:15,366 --> 00:00:17,866
Whereas before in the runtime area
I could only find

7
00:00:17,866 --> 00:00:19,299
the monitoring part of the pods,

8
00:00:19,299 --> 00:00:21,633
now you have the whole workflow
of my infrastructure.

9
00:00:21,933 --> 00:00:28,066
In addition to pods, it is now possible to find: deployments, services, cronjobs, jobs and namespaces.

10
00:00:28,266 --> 00:00:29,766
Let us look at the layout.

11
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:31,233
On the right side,

12
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:33,266
you can manually refresh the data
or decide

13
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:35,399
how often the page should be refreshed.

14
00:00:37,566 --> 00:00:39,032
Then there is the search box

15
00:00:39,032 --> 00:00:40,466
where you can filter the data.

16
00:00:40,466 --> 00:00:42,766
These fields will also be present
in the next tabs,

17
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:45,799
allowing for a smooth navigation
experience in each section.

18
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:51,599
As can be seen by clicking on each tab,

19
00:00:51,599 --> 00:00:54,166
the tables provide the relevant
information.

20
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:02,399
Continue
navigating and click on the namespace.

21
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:05,999
Here you will find all the details
of the namespace and can copy

22
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,699
Expand the entire code or export
the JSON file.

23
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:13,065
Monitoring is essential
to deliver better software, therefore, by

24
00:01:13,065 --> 00:01:15,932
enriching the runtime area,
we want to simplify and improve

25
00:01:15,932 --> 00:01:18,599
the way developers
monitor their pods and services.
