Hello and welcome to the Mia-Platform Video Pills.

2
00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:09,709
In this video, we will see how to enable
preview of new features

3
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:11,444
on the Mia-Platform Console. 

4
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:14,881
This will give you the opportunity
to test the functionality of new products,

5
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:18,184
understand how they fit 
into your software's lifecycle,

6
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:19,719
 and immediately
give feedback to improve it.

7
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:22,922
Starting from the design area,
we notice our default sidebar.

8
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,060
To activate the feature preview function,
go to the top-right navigation bar

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,129
and click on your profile icon,

10
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:30,864
a dropdown menu is displayed.

11
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:33,066
By clicking on feature preview.

12
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,068
a pop up is displayed.

13
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:38,038
Inside is a list of all the features
you can preview and activate.

14
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:39,272
In this video,

15
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:41,541
you will only see one: the “Dynamic Sidebar”.

16
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:45,445
Each feature will have a short description
of the benefits and functionality

17
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:46,880
it is intended to enable.

18
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:50,917
In addition, you will have the opportunity
to give your feedback

19
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:54,254
by clicking the button that will open
Mia-Platform Github Discussions.

20
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:59,259
Clicking on the toggle
you enable the feature.

21
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:03,263
If you refresh the page,
you can see the new "More Feature" tab.

22
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:07,767
In this case, the default sidebar
is switched to a different display mode.

23
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:11,104
Remember that enabled functions
are only active for the user,

24
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:13,406
triggering them
not for the whole platform.

25
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,142
To disable the new function.

26
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:17,477
Simply deactivate it.
