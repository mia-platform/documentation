00:00:04,904 --> 00:00:07,240
Hi, and welcome to Mia-Platform Video
Pills.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,478
In this video, we'll see the new No Code
configuration of Mia-Platform Fast Data.

3
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:14,881
Let's start by opening the design area
and then click

4
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:17,350
on the projection section.

5
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:20,253
Here you will find the connected systems
of record.

6
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,424
In this case,
we have a delivery system already linked

7
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:28,194
by clicking on the new ER Schema tab.

8
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:31,664
You can view all the ER Schemas created,
ready to be edited or deleted.

9
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:37,137
Now let's create a new ER Schema.

10
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:38,671
This is the new No Code

11
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:41,074
interface of Mia-Platform Fast Data.

12
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,611
On the right side
you find all the systems of record

13
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:47,680
together with their projections.

14
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:50,550
While on the left side,
there's the configuration interface

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,819
with the JSON schema.

16
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:57,123
You can easily drag and drop a projection

17
00:00:57,123 --> 00:01:00,293
inside the configurator
to automatically create the JSON file.

18
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:04,664
To create the ER Schema,

19
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:07,901
we just need to insert all the projections
and connect them among each other.

20
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:18,912
Now, by clicking on each projection,
you can see all their detailed data

21
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,246
while by clicking on the arrows

22
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:23,383
you can select the connection type
and set up the connection rules.

23
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,050
In this case,

24
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:28,188
we set up a one to many connection between
the customer and the order projections.

25
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:31,024
Then we click on the “Edit Rules” button
to define the relationship

26
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:34,094
between these two objects
so that the customer ID is equal to

27
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,930
the customer ID in the order.

28
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,800
In the same way,
we set up a one to many connection type

29
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,169
between the orders and the products,
as an order

30
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:46,639
may contain more than one product,
and a product can be part of one order.

31
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:50,710
As before,
we need to define the connection rules

32
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,047
between these two objects
so that the order ID is equal to the order

33
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,216
idea of the products.

34
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:02,655
You can also set up unique relationships
between the objects.

35
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:05,992
For example,
you can select that a single product field

36
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:08,328
is equal to specific order
fields or value.

37
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:17,804
In addition,
you can also add a group to combine

38
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:21,708
a set of rules with a logical operation.

39
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:27,947
The air schema is finally defined.

40
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:29,182
By opening the left tab,

41
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:33,052
we can see that the JSON schema has been
auto generated and it is fully compatible

42
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:35,922
with the previous versions of 
Mia-Platform Fast Data.

43
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,792
Moreover, by clicking on the top arrows,
you can move back

44
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:42,128
and forth in the changes.

45
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,799
Now we can move on to
the the single View section.

46
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:51,871
Click to edit the Single View settings.

47
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:55,041
Open the Single View Creators
tab to view all the microservices

48
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,043
managing the single views.

49
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:59,946
Let's change the default ER Schema,
so that it becomes the new one

50
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:01,948
we created before.

51
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:04,951
As you can see,

52
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:07,287
it has been filled in
with the previous configuration.

53
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,191
By clicking on the ER Schema link,

54
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:15,061
we can go back to the no code interface.
