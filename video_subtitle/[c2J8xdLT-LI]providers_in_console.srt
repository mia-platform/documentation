Hi everyone and welcome to the Mia-Platform
tutorials. Today we're going to see a new

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,240
way of managing providers in the Mia-Platform
Console at the platform level. Providers can

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:16,520
be generically defined as a means of storing
information about external services.To begin

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,640
with we're on the main Mia-Platform homepage,
let's go ahead and enter one of the projects.

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,840
As you can see here in the left hand side menu
there is a tab and under Administration you can

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,080
find the provider section. You can see some
of the providers we've already created such

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,920
as Mia-Platform GitLab and Azure DevOps. Each
provider is listed with the type of capacity

8
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:42,560
and service that is used. Let's go ahead and
try to add a new provider connection. Here

9
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:48,120
you can see a modal window is displayed with all
of the providers existing: there's Azure DevOps,

10
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:55,600
BitBucket, GitHub, GitLab and more. For this
example let's go ahead and click on GitLab. As

11
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,920
you can see here all of the capabilities that you
want to use this provider for have been selected,

12
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,360
but you can go ahead and select whichever ones
you like from Secret Manager, CI/CD Tool and

13
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,640
GitProvider. Once you're happy with that go ahead
and click on next: here you can add your provider

14
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:29,920
name, then you need to add the API base URL, and then you need to add just the base URL.

15
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:36,320
You can also enter a short description if
you'd like. Once you're happy with filling in

16
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,080
the provider details, you can go ahead to the
credentials section. In the credential section

17
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:48,160
you need to add an access token. Once that is
added we will move on to the Advance section.

18
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:54,200
In the advance section you can add a Certificate
Authority and also a proxy if you'd like. Once

19
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,320
you're happy with this let's go ahead and add
provider. Now you can see a provider connection

20
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:05,280
has been created. You can go ahead and close the
model and go to your provider itself. As you can

21
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,000
see in this list you will be able to see the new
provider that we just created; if you would like

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,760
to make any edits to this you can just click on
the arrow and go ahead and edit the credentials,

23
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,520
the advanced credentials or even remove the
connection if you like. With this we have seen

24
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,920
how we can create a provider connection and manage
it in the Mia-Platform Console. With this feature

25
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:32,680
you can manage providers from one place, defining
their capabilities, entering their credentials,

26
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,480
certificate authorities and proxies. Thank
you for watching and as always if you have

27
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:46,600
any questions feel free to reach out to us
or book a demo on the Mia-Platform website!
