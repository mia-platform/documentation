00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:06,680
Hi everyone and welcome to the Mia-Platform
tutorials. Today we're going to take a look

2
00:00:06,681 --> 00:00:12,760
at the Mia-Assistant, which is the AI chatbot
in the Mia-Platform Console. Imagine that

3
00:00:12,761 --> 00:00:17,360
you are a new developer on the Mia-Platform
Console and you want to orchestrate a saga,

4
00:00:17,361 --> 00:00:23,480
but you don't know what to do. This is where the
Mia-Assistant comes in handy! It facilitates the

5
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:28,440
understanding of the console features and
exploration of the product; it also speeds

6
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:34,000
up your search in docs and suggests things that
can be done on the Mia-Platform console. It also

7
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:39,720
simplifies your access to Features. So let's
begin: go ahead here on the lefthand side and

8
00:00:39,721 --> 00:00:44,720
click on Mia-Assistant. This is going to open
the chatbot that will help answer all of your

9
00:00:44,721 --> 00:00:52,040
questions. Let's give it a few commands to test
it out. Let's start with: "Can I orchestrate a

10
00:00:52,041 --> 00:01:00,280
saga?". As you can see here it will return all of
the options for you to orchestrate a saga and will

11
00:01:00,281 --> 00:01:05,560
also link different documents that you can use
to learn more about this. For the second command,

12
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:14,640
let's go ahead and give: "Can you make
an example of an orchestrated saga?".

13
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:18,800
As you can see here the Mia-Assistant
is going to give you an actual real life

14
00:01:18,801 --> 00:01:26,440
example that you can use to create
an orchestrated Saga. Perfect. Now,

15
00:01:26,441 --> 00:01:39,960
if you want to further understand this you
can also ask:"What if it was a saga of a

16
00:01:39,961 --> 00:01:54,280
loyalty program?". As you can see here it
will give you an in-depth answer about the

17
00:01:54,281 --> 00:02:03,880
Saga of a loyalty program. You can also ask:
"How can I install the Flow Manager using the

18
00:02:03,881 --> 00:02:17,320
Console?". Here it will give you the exact code
that you need to install the Flow Manager using

19
00:02:17,321 --> 00:02:26,520
the Console. Perfect, let's go ahead and thank
the Mia-Assistant for helping us with this task,

20
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:30,160
and thank you guys for watching.
