          "**Mongezium** is a CDC (Change Data Capture) connector that captures changes in MongoDB collections and push them to Kafka topics.",
          "Mongezium uses MongoDB change streams to listen for changes in the collections and maps MongoDB change events into events compliant with [Fast-Data message format](/docs/products/fast_data/fast_data_engine_v2/concepts#fast-data-message-format).",
          "Mongezium can be configured with different startup behaviors, such as performing always an initial snapshot on startup, or resuming the change stream from the last known resume token.",
