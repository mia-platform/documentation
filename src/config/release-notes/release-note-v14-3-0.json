            "We resolved an issue that occurred in a specific scenario: when a ConfigMap was deleted and immediately recreated with the same name, the Console could fail to save the change correctly, causing configuration corruption. This configuration can then only be restored using a previous snapshot, which is possible within the [dedicated Revision History modal](/docs/products/console/set-up-infrastructure/revisions-and-versions#revision-history). This fix has been implemented also on _Console Helm Chart_ `v15.0.3-beta.2`."
