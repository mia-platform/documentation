The *User Access Sync* allows to intercept webhook, from both Mia Platform and other infrastructure tools, and perform some configurable actions.
This service could be useful to automatize action that otherwise DevOps team should do by hand.

## How it Works

Once the *User Access Sync* receive a webhook it performs the following actions:
1. it loads all the *rules* configured from the database
2. it verifies which rules match with the actual context or *scope*
3. it performs actions on external tools or *providers*

### Basic Concepts

#### Providers
A provider is a tool that the *User Access Sync* can interact with.
Some example of providers are:
- Mia Platform
- Okta
- Gitlab
- Github

#### Rule
All rules are stored on a database.
A rule is composed by:
- *Id*: unique identifier
- *Description*: (optional) a description for the rule
- *Requirements*: object with information needed to defined if the rule is matched or not
- *Scope*: an object with information on how to use the current rule:
    - *Event*: identifier of the event for which use the current rule
    - *Use Always*: a boolean to define if the current rule has to be used every time the **event** is received by the *User Access Sync*, if false the following fields will be used to filter rules
    - *Evaluate For Each Environment*: a boolean to define if the rule has to be evaluated differently for each scope
    - *Is Production*: (optional) a boolean to define if the rule has to be evaluated if the environment is a production environment or not. Considered only if *Evaluate For Each Environment* flag is true.
    - *Company Ids*: a list of company ids for which the current rule has to be applied; ignored if *useAlways* flag is *true*
    - *Project Ids*: a list of project ids for which the current rule has to be applied; ignored if *useAlways* flag is *true*
- *Actions*: a list of objects with information needed to perform action on a specific provider; the information required by the action can be different between providers. The following fields are in common and required by all actions:
    - *Provider Id*: identifier for the provider related to the action; this has to match with the id used in the *provider configuration file*
```jsonc
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "id": { "type": "string" },
        "description": { "type": "string" },
        "scope": { 
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "event": {"type": "string"},
                "userAlways": {"type": "boolean"},
                "evaluateForEachEnvironment": {"type": "boolean"},
                "isProduction": {"type": "boolean"},
                "companyIds": { 
                    "type": "array",
                    "items": { "type": "string"}
                },
                "projectIds": { 
                    "type": "array",
                    "items": { "type": "string"}
                },
            },
            "required": ["useAlways", "event"]
        },
        "requirements": { 
            "type": "object",
        },
        "actions": { 
            "type": "array",
            "items": { "type": "object" }
        },
    },
    "required": ["id", "scope", "requirements", "actions"]
}

```


### Logging
At the end of each action and for each provider you can find a log in the following format to keep track of the outcome of each action:
```jsonc
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "message": { "type": "string" },
        "summary": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "providerId":  { "type": "string" },
            "event":  { "type": "string" },
            "ruleId":  { "type": "string" },
            "status":  { "type": "string" }, // either "completed" or "failed"
            "details": {
              "type": "object",
              "properties": {
                "action" :  { "type": "string" },
                "status":  { "type": "string" },
                "message":  { "type": "string" },
                "httpEndpoint":  { "type": "string" },
                "httpMethod":  { "type": "string" },
                "details":  { "type": "object" }, // optional futher information related to the action
              }
            }
          }
        }
      
    },
    "required": ["message", "summary"]
}
```

## Use Cases

The *User Access Sync* service enables automatic synchronization of user permissions across various tools in your DevSecOps toolchain. Here are some common use cases:

### Identity Provider to Platform Onboarding
When a new user is added to your identity provider (e.g., Okta), the service can automatically:
- Add the user to one or more Mia-Platform Console companies
- Assign appropriate roles and permissions based on predefined rules
- Send welcome notifications or setup instructions

### Platform to Development Tools Integration
When a user is added to a Mia-Platform company, the service can automatically:
- Add the user to corresponding GitLab groups with appropriate access levels
- Invite the user to relevant GitHub organizations and teams
- Grant access to other development tools and repositories based on their role

### Cross-Platform Permission Management
When user permissions change in one system, the service can:
- Synchronize role changes across all connected platforms
- Ensure consistent access levels between Mia-Platform Console and external tools
- Maintain security compliance by applying the same permission policies everywhere

### User Lifecycle Management
The service can handle the complete user lifecycle:
- **Onboarding**: Automatically provision access to all necessary tools when a user joins
- **Role Changes**: Update permissions across all platforms when a user's role changes
- **Offboarding**: Remove access from all connected systems when a user leaves the organization

### Environment-Specific Access Control
Based on project and environment configurations, the service can:
- Grant production access only to authorized personnel
- Provide different access levels for development, staging, and production environments
- Automatically adjust permissions based on project assignments

### Compliance and Audit
The service helps maintain compliance by:
- Ensuring consistent permission policies across all tools
- Providing audit logs of all permission changes
- Automatically enforcing security policies and access controls

These use cases demonstrate how the *User Access Sync* service reduces manual overhead for DevOps teams while ensuring consistent and secure access management across your entire toolchain.
