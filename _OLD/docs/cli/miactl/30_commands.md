### list

List Marketplace items

#### Synopsis

List the Marketplace items that the current user can access.

#### Usage

```sh
miactl marketplace list --company-id company-id [FLAGS]...
```

#### Flags

- `--public` - if this flag is set, the command fetches not only the items from the requested company, but also the public Marketplace items from other companies.

### get

Get a Marketplace item

#### Synopsis

Get a single Marketplace item

You need to specify either:

- the companyId, itemId and version, via the respective flags (recommended). The company-id flag can be omitted if it is already set in the context.
- the ObjectID of the item with the flag object-id

Passing the ObjectID is expected only when dealing with deprecated Marketplace items missing the itemId and/or version fields.
Otherwise, it is preferable to pass the tuple companyId-itemId-version.

```bash
miactl marketplace get { --item-id item-id --version version } | --object-id objectID [FLAGS]...
```

### delete

Delete a Marketplace item

#### Synopsis

Delete a single Marketplace item

You need to specify either:

- the companyId, itemId and version, via the respective flags (recommended). The company-id flag can be omitted if it is already set in the context.
- the ObjectID of the item with the flag object-id

Passing the ObjectID is expected only when dealing with deprecated Marketplace items missing the itemId and/or version fields.
Otherwise, it is preferable to pass the tuple companyId-itemId-version.

```bash
miactl marketplace delete { --item-id item-id --version version } | --object-id object-id [flags]...
```

### apply

Create or update Marketplace items

#### Synopsis

Create or update one or more Marketplace items.

The flag -f accepts either files or directories. In case of directories, it explores them recursively.

Supported formats are JSON (.json files) and YAML (.yaml or .yml files).

The file can contain an image object with the following format:

```json
"image": {
	"localPath": "./someImage.png"
}
```

The localPath can be absolute or relative to the file location.
The image will be uploaded along with the Marketplace item.
Before being applied, the "image" key will be replaced with the "imageUrl" referring to the uploaded image.
You can retrieve the updated item with the "get" command.

You can also specify the "supportedByImage" in a similar way.

Be aware that the presence of both "image" and "imageUrl" and/or of both "supportedByImage" and "supportedByImageUrl" is ambiguous and raises an error.

```bash
miactl marketplace apply { -f file-path }... } [flags]
```

#### Examples

```bash

# Apply the configuration of the file myFantasticGoTemplate.json located in the current directory to the Marketplace
miactl marketplace apply -f myFantasticGoTemplate.json

# Apply the configurations in myFantasticGoTemplate.json and myFantasticNodeTemplate.yml to the Marketplace, with relative paths
miactl marketplace apply -f ./path/to/myFantasticGoTemplate.json -f ./path/to/myFantasticNodeTemplate.yml

# Apply all the valid configuration files in the directory myFantasticGoTemplates to the Marketplace
miactl marketplace apply -f myFantasticGoTemplates
```
