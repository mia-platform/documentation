## Fast Data

### Introducing Mongezium: MongoDB to Kafka CDC Connector

**Mongezium** is a CDC (Change Data Capture) connector that captures changes in MongoDB collections and push them to Kafka topics.  
Mongezium uses MongoDB change streams to listen for changes in the collections and maps MongoDB events into schemaless [Debezium-like messages](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/mongodb.html#mongodb-events).  
Mongezium can be configured with different startup behaviors, such as performing always an initial snapshot on startup, or resuming the change stream from the last known resume token.  
To know more about how to configure Mongezium CDC, visit the [official documentation](/runtime_suite/mongezium-cdc/10_overview.md).
