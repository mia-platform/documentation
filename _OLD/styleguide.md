# Style guidelines

A good documentation is consistent in its style. To achieve a high level of consistency we base our guidelines on [the standard proposed by Apple](https://help.apple.com/applestyleguide/#/). In this document we specify additional rules, but if you are in doubt or don't find enough information here, have a look at the Apple style guide.
Before writing any documentation, it is mandatory to read the [common pitfalls](#common-pitfalls) section.

## Common pitfalls

- Do not use contractions:
  - Correct: `it is`
  - Incorrect: `it's`
- Use gender-neutral pronouns:
  - Correct: `A subscriber can post their recipes to your shared folder.`
  - Incorrect: `A subscriber can post his or her recipes to your shared folder.`
- In general, in cases where American spelling differs from Commonwealth/"British" spelling, use the American spelling:
  - Correct: `color`
  - Incorrect: `colour`
- Use second person sentences
  - Correct: `You can perform the action by pressing the button`
  - Incorrect: `We can perform the action by pressing the button`
