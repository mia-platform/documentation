00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:07,507
Hi, and welcome to Mia-Platform Pills.

2
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:09,743
Today we will show you how to create
service accounts,

3
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,811
which are not human users
that can be employed

4
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:15,448
to implement automated processes
with machine-to-machine communication.

5
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:16,916
Let's start.

6
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:19,886
Access to the Platform Overview
by clicking on the icon.

7
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:24,057
Once on the page, simply
click on “Identities” in the left sidebar.

8
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:26,926
Here you have an overview
of all the users on the platform.

9
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:29,162
Now let us try to add a new Service Account

10
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:31,264
which we have just said
is a non-human user.

11
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:33,733
Click on “Add User”
and then on “Add Service Account”.

12
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:37,137
Firstly, give it a name.

13
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:39,439
There are then two different methods
of adding it

14
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,509
using Client Secret Basic
or a Private Key JWT.

15
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,779
Choose the Client Secret Basic method.

16
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:48,148
Now, as an actual user,
you need to assign a role

17
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:50,583
representing a set of permissions
within the platform.

18
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:55,622
Once created,
the credential must be saved.

19
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:57,223
For security reasons,

20
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:00,460
the generated Client Secret
is only visible once in this screen.

21
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:03,096
If you don't save it,
you will not able to retrieve it.

22
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,499
So click on the copy icon
and store it in a safe place.

23
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:13,173
The client idea is displayed
in the table instead.

24
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:18,011
Let us now add a new Service Account
with the Private Key JWT method.

25
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:21,081
Click on the “Add User” button and perform
the previous steps.

26
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,052
Here you can paste your public certificate

27
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:28,855
while your private certificate
will be used to sign the token.

28
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,158
Assign the role and remember

29
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:33,927
to save the key ID.

30
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:39,466
Let's test our Service Account.

31
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:40,834
To the purpose of this video,

32
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:44,003
we will generate a token
only for the client secret basic method.

33
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,241
The token is created by taking the clientID:clientsecret

34
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:51,744
 encoding it in base64, 
creating an intermediate token.

35
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:56,649
The call will return this token.

36
00:01:56,649 --> 00:02:00,954
As you may notice, this token has
an expiry date. For long term operations,

37
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:03,256
it is necessary to request it
several times.

38
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:07,861
Remember that it is always possible
to change the role of a Service Account

39
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,129
or delete it.

40
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,873
Service Accounts
can be created on a platform, project,

41
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:23,543
or runtime environment level, based on where
they need to perform their task.

42
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:27,147
For example, here
we're creating it in a project

43
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,249
so it will be applied
only in the current space.

44
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,586
Service Accounts can automate processes
acting as real users.

45
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:38,191
For example, they can trigger automatic
deploys or to perform monitoring actions.
