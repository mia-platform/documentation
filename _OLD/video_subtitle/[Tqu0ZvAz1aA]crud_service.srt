Hi everyone, this is Rhea from Mia-Platform and 
today I'm going to show you how you can create  

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,040
a CRUD service using the Mia-Platform Console. 
Let's go ahead and start with the Mia-Platform  

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,360
Console. We're in the design section. Let's go 
ahead and scroll down to MongoDB CRUDs and here  

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:21,160
we can click on "Create a new CRUD". Let's 
start by giving it a name: for this example,  

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,920
I'm going to give it the name "employee2" 
and click on "Create". Perfect, as you can  

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:32,280
see here this is a collection of employee2 and 
all of the fields are attached below. Let's add  

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:38,040
some of our own fields. Let's go ahead and write 
"Name" set the field type as string and click on  

8
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:45,640
"Create". Let's add another one for "Last name" 
or surname, create, set the type as string and  

9
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:52,120
go ahead and create, and then we can add the 
third one as "email ID" where we also set the  

10
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:58,760
type as string and go ahead and click on create. 
Perfect, as you can see collection employee2 now  

11
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,320
has three different fields that we have added: 
name, surname and email ID, which are all type  

12
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:10,240
string. Once you're happy with that we need to go 
ahead and create and expose the endpoint. Let's  

13
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,760
scroll in this menu to find "Endpoint" and create 
a new endpoint. Let's name the base part of this  

14
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:22,280
endpoint "employee 2 ", let's select the endpoint 
type as CRUD and then choose the base part. The  

15
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:28,960
base part is employee2, the crud we just created. 
Let's go ahead and click on "Create". Once this is  

16
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,680
created of course you can see here you can change 
the security and documentation settings and once  

17
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,440
this is created it's time for us to save our 
configuration. Let's move ahead to the left hand  

18
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:44,760
side menu and click on "Save configuration". When 
you're saving your configuration you will have to  

19
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:51,080
write a title commit - for this example let's go 
ahead and write "commit employee2" and go ahead  

20
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:59,320
and save that. Perfect, your configuration is now 
saved and everything is up to date. The next step  

21
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,960
would be moving into the deploy section. Let's go 
ahead here into the deploy section and select our  

22
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:13,280
branch. Our branch is master and here we can go 
ahead and smart deploy our CRUD function. Perfect,  

23
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:21,960
as you can see our CRUD function is ready and 
we can go ahead and click on Smart Deploy.

24
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,320
Perfect, as you can see your deploy is now 
successful and now we can move into the  

25
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,200
runtime section. Perfect, now we've entered 
our runtime section where you can see all of  

26
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,560
the pods that are running and you can see that 
all of them are at status "okay" - this means  

27
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,200
we can go ahead into the overview section and 
enter environments where in which we'll be able  

28
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,760
to see the runtime environments and access the 
API portal. We're in the development section,  

29
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:55,520
let's go ahead to documentation 
which opens up your API portal.

30
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,360
Perfect, we've now entered our API portal 
where we can see our function employee2,  

31
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,120
the CRUD service we created. Let's go ahead and 
put in some data using the "Post" function. As you  

32
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:12,920
can see here we can add some parameters, so "name" 
let's go ahead and put in Rhea, "surname" let's go  

33
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:22,640
ahead and put in Arora and "email ID" let's go 
ahead and put in rheaaroraxyz@gmail.com.Perfect,  

34
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,400
once you're happy with this we can go ahead and 
click on "Try it". Once you try it this is going  

35
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:36,120
to generate an ID. Let's go ahead and copy paste 
that ID and now let's move into the get function.  

36
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,320
This is where we'll be able to return a list of 
all of the documents we've added in employee2,  

37
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:47,080
so let's go ahead into get the get function 
and put in an ID and go ahead and click on  

38
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,560
"Try it". Perfect, as you can see this has 
worked well: you're able to see the name,  

39
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,400
the surname and the email ID. So that's 
basically how you create a CRUD service  

40
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,960
on the Mia-Platform console - it's super easy
