00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,240
Hi, and welcome to Mia-Platform Video
Pills.

2
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,610
In this video, we will show
you Mia-Platform Bucket Storage.

3
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:14,547
Bucket Storage extends the functionality
of Mia-Platform Fast Data

4
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:16,649
and provides storage of raw data.

5
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:20,020
This data is ready to be re-injected
when needed or can be served to business

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,424
intelligence, relieving DB administration.
To better understand how it works,

7
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:27,827
we will only show you the microservices
to be installed in a use case.

8
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:32,899
As you can see, we have already set up
the Mia-Platform Fast Data projections

9
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:36,202
with a ER Schema with these entries:
customer, order, and product.

10
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:39,305
In addition,
we already have a Single View called

11
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:40,807
Order History.

12
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:45,145
Let's install the first microservice.

13
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:48,782
Go to the microservices section and search
for the Ingestion Storage Service.

14
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:55,321
During installation,
remember to set the correct environment

15
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:58,024
variables, configuration
maps and Secret Keys.

16
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,607
Letâ€™s deploy it

17
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:25,852
We can now see that

18
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,054
we have our empty bucket.

19
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:35,462
With Postman,

20
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:39,399
we populate our bucket with the customer.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,369
Now we can see that
we have generated a new customer.

22
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:47,040
We now install the second microservice we need:

23
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,141
Ingestion Reloader.

24
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:53,680
Find it on Mia-Platform marketplace and install it

25
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,649
with all the configurations and secrets
as we did before.

26
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,893
Expose the API and deploy it.

27
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,940
Now we can take a look at our use case.

28
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,808
In MongoDB,

29
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,409
we already have some pre-filled data,

30
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:25,979
topics already mentioned
at the beginning of this video.

31
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:30,650
As you can see, we have a customer,
some orders, a single view that aggregates

32
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,887
the orders, a number of products
and returning to the single view,

33
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,622
within the orders we can see the products.

34
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,126
Let us switch to our bucket

35
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:42,162
and see that we have folders
for each topic.

36
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,600
For example, we can see the orders here.

37
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:51,504
Now we delete our orders and show how
to reinject the same data from the bucket.

38
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,342
The order collection is now empty.

39
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,378
We also have no data in the Single View.

40
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:03,082
To reingest the data, we go to Postman.

41
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:05,084
We declare that we want to input order
data.

42
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:09,155
Let's click on Send.

43
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,893
Now, going back to MongoDB,

44
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:16,996
you can see again orders both in the topic
and in the single view.

45
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:23,770
The main benefits of Bucket Storage
include: providing large storage space

46
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,871
at a reduced cost,

47
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:28,374
becoming an easily accessible repository
for backup and compliance

48
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:32,312
reasons, enabling easy exposure of data
to business intelligence tools.

49
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,047
Try it with 

50
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,148
Mia-Platform v11.
