Hi, and welcome to Mia-Platform Video
Pills.

2
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:10,643
In this video, we will see how we have
improved the experience of connecting

3
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:13,580
and editing a cluster within
Mia-Platform Console.

4
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:17,384
From the homepage, you can click on the icons
besides your platforms,

5
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:18,952
or you can open the right menu

6
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:21,421
and click on your companies
to view all your platforms.

7
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:24,190
By clicking on one of the displayed
platforms,

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,427
you can access the cluster section
to view all your connected clusters.

9
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:30,764
In this example, the platform doesn't
have any connected cluster.

10
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,899
We can create a new cluster connection

11
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:35,135
by clicking on the Add cluster connection
button.

12
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:39,873
As you can see, we support by default
all the major cloud providers

13
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:43,309
like GCP, a AWS, Azure and Oracle Cloud.

14
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:44,677
You can also connect

15
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:48,348
additional ones as long as they have
a Kubernetes or OpenShift distribution.

16
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:51,351
Let's create
a new cluster connection on GCP.

17
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:55,121
Let's select Kubernetes as a Runtime Service.

18
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:58,191
At this point,
we should insert the cluster details.

19
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,593
So we add the cluster ID,

20
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,699
the geographic location

21
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,469
and a description.

22
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:14,541
Finally,
we have to complete the connection

23
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:17,577
by adding the cluster URL,

24
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,213
the Proxy URL,

25
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:24,951
a cluster token,

26
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:28,455
and optionally an authority certificate.

27
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:30,356
This message confirms
that that the cluster

28
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:32,525
is finally connected.

29
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,063
As Mia-Platform supports
multi-cloud environments,

30
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,332
you can add another cluster
from a different provider.

31
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:42,035
Let's click again
on Add Cluster Connection.

32
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:46,272
Select “other” as cloud provider
and Kubernetes is runtime service.

33
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:49,008
We now fill in the new cluster details.

34
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,778
Finally,
we insert the cluster and proxy URL,

35
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,914
The cluster token, and eventually
the certificate of authority.

36
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:57,684
The new cluster is connected.

37
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:58,952
Within your environment.

38
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:02,422
You will find the two connected clusters
with the details about the runtime

39
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:06,559
services, the Kubernetes versions,
and the cluster URL.
