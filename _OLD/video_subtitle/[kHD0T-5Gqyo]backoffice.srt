00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:07,240
Hi and welcome to Mia-Platform video
Pills.

2
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:08,274
In this video,

3
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:11,811
we will show you the new low code
capability of Mia-Platform Back Office.

4
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:13,079
Let's start.

5
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:15,582
We have already installed the Back Office
application.

6
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:18,051
In fact,
the sidebar shows the dedicated tab.

7
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:20,520
Click on it
and take a moment to explore the section.

8
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:22,155
We reached the pages

9
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:25,458
section where we can create a new page
for our Back Office.

10
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:28,395
By default, an example page is created.

11
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:30,764
Next, we have the layout section
where we can edit

12
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:33,299
the basic properties
and configurations of the theme.

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,103
We move on to the settings section,
where we find the URIs

14
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:40,407
error pages, Mount Point, import
map and shared properties.

15
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,076
Next,
you can see the configuration section

16
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:46,379
of the web server with headers,
entry points and content types.

17
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:50,083
At the end, It is the advanced configuration,

18
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:53,386
which allows us to edit the code directly
with the help of a preview.

19
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:58,591
To see how easy it is to manage
the Back Office, let us create a new page.

20
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:01,261
Back to the pages. Click on Add new page.

21
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:05,131
Once the modal is displayed, select
iFrame as the page type,

22
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:08,968
decide a name and a rendering route.

23
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:10,703
Click on next,

24
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,807
Enter the iFrame source and click Save.

25
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:17,710
The new page is now listed in the table

26
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,879
To display the new page
in the navigation bar.

27
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,448
Go to the layout tab. 

28
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:23,249
Here, a new menu item can be added.

29
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,485
Go to menu
items and click edit properties.

30
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:27,520
Add a new item
and write the configuration.

31
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:31,391
Save.

32
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:33,426
We now have a new menu item.

33
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,695
Go to the advanced
tab to see a running preview

34
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:41,134
Save the project.

35
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:44,437
Now, deploy it.

36
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:51,277
If we navigate

37
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:54,481
to the public URL,
we can see the new page in the sidebar.

38
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:56,616
Let's create a new page type.

39
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:58,518
Instead of iFrame,

40
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,386
select Compose.

41
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:01,621
Call the page “Users”.

42
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,324
Use “Users” also for the rendering route.

43
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,059
Click on next.

44
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,762
Here we can see that we can choose
different page templates such as:

45
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:14,067
blank page, page with table, calendar view, picture
gallery and details page.

46
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,469
Each page has its own goal.

47
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:20,039
For example, a calendar page might be
useful for an appointment manager.

48
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:24,377
An image gallery page might be perfect
if you have to manage various media files.

49
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:27,147
Go ahead and choose the page
with the table template.

50
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:27,847
Save it.

51
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:29,682
Unlike the iFrame page type, 

52
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:32,418
the compose page type
allows you to configure several options.

53
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:34,020
Click on the button.

54
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,922
A preview page is opening.

55
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:39,325
Here you can adapt the page your business
needs, starting with the page name

56
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,462
or the text of the search bar up
to some advanced functions.

57
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,230
For example, the table field.

58
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,108
We now connect the data collections.

59
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,343
In this case under connectors
and adapters.

60
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,512
We select “/users” for the CRUD service.

61
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:04,117
Once done, add the new item to the menu.

62
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:07,187
Instead of using the low code
configuration, you now use

63
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,789
the advanced settings
where you can directly add the code.

64
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:13,593
Here's the new menu item.

65
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,995
Save the configuration.

66
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,934
Now we can deploy and see the result.

67
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:23,736
Refreshing the page.

68
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:27,106
We find our page with the tables already
populated with user data.

69
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:32,378
Finally, we customize our layout.

70
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,081
For example, we can switch the navigation layout.

71
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:40,320
Let us say that our brand is green.

72
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,590
Of course, we can modify our layout
with a green user interface.

73
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:56,135
Thanks to this low code function,
the Back Office becomes a powerful tool,

74
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:59,639
highly customizable and quickly adaptable
to your business needs.

75
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,842
In a short time, a data-rich, scalable
and high performance

76
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:06,179
tool can be implemented
abstracting the complexity of maintenance.
