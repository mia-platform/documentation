For the purpose of facilitating the creation of [your microservices](/development_suite/api-console/api-design/plugin_baas_4.md) and interact with Mia-Platform using different languages and frameworks, we have developed a set of libraries.

We'll call these libraries **Mia service libraries**. You can find ready-to-use libraries on [Mia-Platform Github repository](https://github.com/mia-platform).

Currently available libraries are:

| **Library**                                                                                      | **Technologies**         |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| ------------------------ |
| [Mia service Node.js library](/development_suite/api-console/api-design/plugin_baas_4.md)        | Node.js, JavaScript      |
| [Mia service Java library](https://github.com/mia-platform/custom-plugin-java)                   | Kotlin/Java              |
| [Mia service Spring Boot library](https://github.com/mia-platform/custom-plugin-java-springboot) | Spring Boot, Kotlin/Java |
| [Mia service NET library](https://github.com/mia-platform/Mia-service-Net-Library)               | .NET, C#                 |

More libraries are in development, but if you need to create microservices in a specific language or framework and feel the need for a library, you can [build your own yourself](/libraries/create-new-library.md).
