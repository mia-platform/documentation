## AI Native DevX

AI-Native Developer Experience (DevX) enhances engineering productivity by seamlessly embedding Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the developer workflow. At its core, this approach harnesses AI-powered conversational interfaces that deliver immediate, context-aware support tailored to individual developer needs. These intelligent experiences simplify the discovery and use of internal services, surface actionable insights from operational data, and foster a more empowered, efficient development environment.

This AI-Native DevX offers:
- A context-aware intelligent assistant embedded throughout the entire software development lifecycle;
- Intelligent engineering AI agents that execute, compose, and orchestrate tasks by leveraging deep platform context and operational awareness.

### AI Agent Use Cases

With the introduction of AI-Native capabilities, we’re unlocking new ways to harness the power of AI within a Platform context. As a use cases, we’re currently offering:

- **AI Agent for Service Composition:** Leveraging the context of the software catalog, this agent can understand your prompt and suggest a tailored list of existing services, also providing reference architectures. You can then quickly instantiate these services within your Projects, streamlining the setup process and accelerating development.

- **AI Agent for Faster Prototyping**: A simple, intuitive interface that helps you write source code and provides a visual preview of what you're building in real time. When combined with the Service Composition AI Agent, it significantly accelerates Project setup and prototype development.

- **AI Agent for Debugging**:  Within any Project, just type /debug in the Mia-Assistant chat to start exploring insights about your Runtime. Make sure the AI Settings toggle is enabled to grant Mia-Assistant access to your Project resources. Once activated, you can begin debugging effortlessly using Debug with Mia-Assistant.

### AI-Compliance for Data Catalog: AI-powered Data Discovery

To meet the increasing demand for accessible, reliable, and governance-oriented Data Discovery, the Data Catalog has been enhanced with an AI Assistant. Through a dedicated user interface, users - *especially non-technical roles like Data Protection Officers (DPOs)* - can interact with a chat to explore all Data Catalog metadata information using natural language.

For example, the AI Compliance Assistant allows users to ask:

- *"What categories of personal data are processed?"*
- *"Who has access to the data? Are they all internal employees or also external consultants?"*
- *"Is there any data transfer, and if so, where? Within the EU or outside?"*
- *"Which personal data assets are classified as sensitive under GDPR, and where are they stored?"*

For DPOs, it enables transparent, on-demand access to data-related information, simplifies GDPR audit preparation and documentation, and reduces dependency on technical teams, saving time and effort.

This AI-powered integration bridges the gap between legal, compliance, and data teams, making governance more inclusive, efficient, and effective.
