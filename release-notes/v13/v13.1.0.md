## Console

### Manage iFrame extensions from Console UI

We are constantly enriching our ecosystem by bringing new features to our Platforge Extensibility Kit: from now on, you will be able to add iFrame extensions in Console directly via a dedicated "Extensions" manager, available - for Company Owners - at Company level in the Platforge section!

Start customizing your Console by adding your first iFrame extension: simply select the Area and Sidebar section from the available options and add the entry URL you want to make visible to your users!

To discover more, head to the [Extensions documentation page](/docs/13.7.5/console/company-configuration/extensions). 

### Compare changes feature available for non-Enhanced Projects

Already present for all Enhanced projects, this feature has now been brought to non-Enhanced projects as well.

Furthermore, the resources in the compare interface will now be differentiated into 3 different categories: Workload, Configmaps and Custom Resources.

For more information, visit the related [documentation page](/docs/13.7.5/development_suite/deploy/overview#compare-changes).

:::info
For implementation requirements it has been modified the previous API interface of the compare changes feature.

If necessary, the new interface documentation can be found directly through the console API Portal.

### Improvements

#### Enhanced Workflow as Default in Project Creation

The Enhanced Workflow is now enabled by default when creating new Projects, with the toggle switched on automatically isn the Project creation flow.

:::info
Please note that, in the next future, new Projects will **exclusively** be created with the Enhanced Workflow, fostering better performances and leveraging features such as GitOps, Custom Orchestrators and quicker configuration save time!

More information will be provided with future Console updates. To discover more about Enhanced Project Workflow, visit the related [documentation page](/docs/13.7.5/development_suite/set-up-infrastructure/enhanced-project-workflow).
:::

#### New Apply Extension Body Schema

The `PUT /api/extensibility/tenants/{tenantId}/extensions` used to register extensions supports a new body format that is clearer and simpler to use, along with the manifest to be sent using the miactl `extensions apply` command.  

:::tip
The legacy body format is still supported until the next minor version, we strongly suggest to start using the new schema following the instructions below as soon as possible.
In addition, make sure to upgrade [`miactl`](/docs/13.7.5/cli/miactl/overview) to version 0.15 to make use of the new format.
:::


  Migration guide from legacy to new apply body format

Starting from the following legacy format as example:

```json
{
  "extensionId": "my-extension-id",
  "name": "My Extension",
  "entry": "https://example.com/",
  "extensionType": "iframe",
  "contexts": ["project"],
  "description": "Example Extension",
  "permissions": [],
  "routes": [
    {
      "destinationPath": "/",
      "icon": {
        "name": "PiProjectorScreenChartLight"
      },
      "id": "my-route",
      "labelIntl": {
        "en": "My Extension",
        "it": "La mia estensione"
      },
      "order": 200.0,
      "locationId": "project",
      "parentId": "my-menu-group"
    },
    {
      "id": "my-menu-group",
      "labelIntl": {
        "en": "My Menu Group",
        "it": "Il mio gruppo menu"
      },
      "locationId": "project",
      "renderType": "category",
      "order": 100.0,
    },
  ]
}
```

it is possible to migrate to new format properties following the mapping explained by this table:

| New schema properties | Legacy schema properties   |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| extensionId           | extensionId                |
| name                  | name                       |
| entry                 | entry                      |
| type                  | extensionType              |
| activationContexts    | contexts                   |
| description           | description                |
| permissions           | permission                 |
| destination.id        | mainRoute.locationId       |
| destination.path      | mainRoute.destinationPath  |
| iconName              | mainRoute.icon.name        |
| menu.id               | mainRoute.id               |
| menu.labelIntl        | mainRoute.labelIntl        |
| menu.order            | mainRoute.order            |
| category.id           | mainRoute.parentId         |
| category.labelIntl    | categoryRoute.labelIntl    |
| category.order        | categoryRoute.order        |

where:

- **mainRoute** is the last route in the `routes` legacy properties that does not define renderType, so the route with `my-route` ID.
- **categoryRoute** is the last route in the `routes` legacy properties that defines renderType as `category`. This is the custom category registered with the extension and it could be omitted in the request, in fact in this case the new `category` properties will have only the `id` defined taken by the `mainRoute.parentId`. In the example above there is a custom category and corresponding to the route with `my-menu-group` ID.

After migration the new body format is the following:

```json
{
  "extensionId": "my-extension-id",
  "name": "My Extension",
  "entry": "https://example.com/",
  "type": "iframe",
  "activationContexts": ["project"],
  "description": "Example Extension",
  "permissions": [],
  "destination": {
      "id": "project",
      "path": "/",
  },
  "iconName": "PiProjectorScreenChartLight",
  "menu": {
    "id": "my-route",
    "labelIntl": {
      "en": "My Extension",
      "it": "La mia estensione"
    },
    "order": 200.0,
  },
  "category": { 
      "id": "my-menu-group",
      "labelIntl": {
        "en": "My Menu Group",
        "it": "Il mio gruppo menu"
      },
      "order": 100.0,
  }
}
```
