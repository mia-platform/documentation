:::caution
This version is affected by a bug in the Flow Manager Configurator that prevents saving the configuration if this section is not opened during the session in the Design Area before saving. This bug occurs in case the Flow Manager Configurator has been already adopted in lower Console versions. This bug has been solved in `v13.0.1`. For on-premise installations we recommend not to use this version. Please check the `v13.0.1` Release notes [here](/docs/13.x.x/release-notes/v13.0.1).

Additionally, several changes and fixes have been added to the [No Code Aggregation](/docs/13.x.x/fast_data/configuration/config_maps/aggregation#use-the-no-code):

* Aggregation mappings that contain the `__fromFile__` keyword or constant values (e.g. `__string__[]`) are no longer erased when adding a new dependency or setting a new path
* dependencies that contain the `aliasOf` keyword are now correctly handled and it is possible to map them and set Aggregation paths without raising configuration errors
* Single Views and CRUD collections can now be used as [Base Projection](/docs/13.x.x/fast_data/concepts/glossary#fast-data-terms) options inside the Aggregation placeholder or the Single View Creator `Settings` tab
* newly selected fields for Aggregation mapping are not deselected when not configured
* the warning and error icons are updated correctly when mapping a field
* Array of String fields are now handled inside the Aggregation `Advanced mode` 
* it is now possible to correctly add new dependencies for nested fields
* an info badge now appears when a selected dependency contains `Object` or `Array` type fields, guiding the use of the `__fromFile__` keyword

* the `Set path` modal width has been adjusted

#### Deprecations

Here is reported the list of features that have been deprecated and that will be removed in the future releases.

:::caution
##### Conditional Expression on Dependencies

In the Single View aggregation configuration, the advanced functionality [conditional expression on dependencies](/docs/13.x.x/fast_data/configuration/config_maps/aggregation#using-conditional-expressions-on-dependencies-definitions-and-mappings)
(employed via `_select` keyword) has been deprecated.  
It will be replaced in the future with a better solution for pre-filtering which projections should be included in the aggregation process

### Fast Data Services

#### Real Time Updater

The new version `v7.7.0` of the _Real Time Updater_ is available!

##### New Features

* introduce support for [Runtime Management](/docs/13.x.x/fast_data/runtime_management/overview) features, that is the interaction with Fast Data Control Plane. This
can be enabled adding the dedicated configuration to the service as described in the [workloads page](/docs/13.x.x/fast_data/runtime_management/workloads?workload=rtu)

#### Bug Fix

This version addressed a few bugs, here is a comprehensive list:

* the maximum number of `pr-updates` events that are produced on a topic within a single batch has been capped. In this
manner the maximum batch size is not exceeded, especially when compressing messages before sending them on the topics.

For more information check out the service [changelog](/docs/13.x.x/runtime_suite/real-time-updater/changelog).

#### Projection Storer

The new version `v1.2.1` of the _Projection Storer_ is available!

##### New Features

* introduce support for [Runtime Management](/docs/13.x.x/fast_data/runtime_management/overview) features, that is the interaction with Fast Data Control Plane. This
  can be enabled adding the dedicated configuration to the service as described in the [workloads page](/docs/13.x.x/fast_data/runtime_management/workloads?workload=projection-storer)

#### Improvements

* changed Kafka partition assigner to better handle rebalance operations
* relaxed Kafka configuration constraints to allow changing a few more properties, such as auto-topic creation. Please, notice that we recommend carefully consider the amount of partitions and settings each `ingestion` and `pr-update` topic should receive to maximize system throughput
* clarified explanation of some service [runtime errors](/docs/13.x.x/fast_data/troubleshooting/fast_data_error_codes#projection-storer), especially the one related to communication errors between internal components
* added secrets loading (plain value, from environment variable or from file) in service configuration file. More details can be found in this [page](/docs/13.x.x/fast_data/configuration/secrets_resolution)

#### Bug Fix

This version addressed a few bugs, here is a comprehensive list:

* the service does not throw anymore in case `pr-updates` topics were not provided in the configuration. Instead, it logs a warning. This enables the use case where the Projection Storer is employed as a standalone component for just ingesting change events without notifying downstream components.
* reworked the internal behavior that previously prevented the service to timely restart when an unrecoverable error was encountered

For more information check out the service [changelog](/docs/13.x.x/runtime_suite/projection-storer/changelog).

#### Single View Trigger Generator

The new version `v3.3.1` of the _Single View Trigger Generator_ is available!

##### New Features

* introduce support for [Runtime Management](/docs/13.x.x/fast_data/runtime_management/overview) features, that is the interaction with Fast Data Control Plane. This

* added secrets loading (plain value, from environment variable or from file) in service configuration file. More details can be found in this [page](/docs/13.x.x/fast_data/configuration/secrets_resolution)

For more information check out the service [changelog](/docs/13.x.x/runtime_suite/single-view-trigger-generator/changelog).

#### Single View Creator

The new version `v6.7.1` of the _Single View Creator_ is available!

##### New Features

* introduce support for [Runtime Management](/docs/13.x.x/fast_data/runtime_management/overview) features, that is the interaction with Fast Data Control Plane. This

##### Improvements

* introduced `KAFKA_SECURITY_PROTOCOL` to govern whether to enable SSL when
the configured connection is  authenticated

#### Bug Fix

This version addressed a few bugs, here is a comprehensive list:

* the service is now able to properly emit Kafka heartbeats even during high utilization
periods. This prevents the service to randomly restart even when no error was encountered

For more information check out the service [changelog](/docs/13.x.x/runtime_suite/single-view-creator/changelog).

## Data Catalog

### Data Catalog Agent Template

The new version `v0.5.1` of the _Data Catalog Agent_ template is available!

#### Breaking Changes

Configuration logic has been reviewed to [support secrets loading](/docs/13.x.x/runtime_suite_templates/data-catalog-agent/20_configuration#secret-support) in several locations:

* connection passwords
* connection strings
* salesforce secrets
* PEM private keys  
  
It is **breaking** on targets of type `mia-console`, which now requires private keys to be an object with the following format

  ```json
  {
    "type": "file",
    "path": "/path/to/key"
  }
  ```
instead of a plain path string.

##### New Features

[Salesforce SObjects](/docs/13.x.x/runtime_suite_templates/data-catalog-agent/20_configuration#salesforce-sobjects) have been added among the supported Data Sources, so that it is possible to configure the Agent to gather metadata from the ones deployed in your projects environments.

##### Improvements

* introduce support for insecure tls connections on all http clients
* introduce support for custom root certificates or self-signed certificates on all http clients

:::info
In order to get access to this new feature, please remember to rebuild your Data Catalog Agent image against the newer Agent template version.
