## Data Lineage

Mia-Platform Data Catalog introduces the [Data Lineage](/docs/13.x.x/data_catalog/frontend/data_lineage), a powerful tool for understanding, visualizing, and describing the flow and transformations of data within an organization.  

This feature allows users to explore data relationships at two levels: **Table Lineage** and **System of Record (SoR) Lineage**, offering both detailed insights and a high-level overview. 

![Data Lineage](img/data-lineage-overview.png)

At the [Table-Level Lineage](/docs/13.x.x/data_catalog/frontend/data_lineage#table-level-lineage), users can dive into the interconnections between individual tables, visualizing data flows and the transformations applied along the way. Users can also enrich the lineage with virtual assets and jobs, useful to complete relationships that have not yet been automatically retrieved, ensuring that context and purpose of data flows are thoroughly captured and properly described.  
The [SoR-Level Lineage](/docs/13.x.x/data_catalog/frontend/data_lineage#system-of-record-level-lineage) shows an aggregated view of data flows across Systems of Records, simplifying the identification of dependencies and bottlenecks at a broader scale, and clarifying how various systems interact within the organization.

If you are using [Fast Data Control Plane](/fast_data/runtime_management/overview), the aggregation processes configured in your Fast Data Projects can be automatically captured in the Data Lineage, making Fast Data jobs visible on the Lineage canvas. To know more about how to acquire information from the Fast Data pipelines, visit the [related documentation](/docs/13.x.x/data_catalog/data_catalog_job_runner#fast-data-jobs-sync).

## Connections Management in Data Catalog Application

The [Connections Management](/docs/13.x.x/data_catalog/frontend/data_catalog_connections) feature in Mia-Platform Data Catalog enables users to retrieve and leverage metadata from [various supported providers](/docs/13.x.x/data_catalog/frontend/data_catalog_connections#connection-providers), supporting critical operations such as [Asset Discovery](/docs/13.x.x/data_catalog/frontend/data_catalog_assets) and [Lineage Analysis](/docs/13.x.x/data_catalog/frontend/data_lineage).  

![Data Catalog Connections Management](img/data-catalog-connections-management.png)

Through the Connections Panel, users can manage the lifecycle of connections, from creation to deletion, and having access to a detailed overview of all configured connections.  
Once a connection is established, assets can be imported directly into the Data Catalog using the Data Catalog Sync feature. To know more about the processes to update the state of the Data Catalog solution, visit the [following documentation](/docs/13.x.x/data_catalog/data_catalog_job_runner#available-jobs).

## Centralized management of the Container Registries 

Gain more control over your container registries in your Projects! You can now easily manage and monitor them directly within your Project settings, where you can view, create, and delete them according to your purposes. 
This update enables centralized monitoring and control of your registries, and allows you to specify the desired registry at the service level in the Design area.

## Enhanced Item Management: Edit Items in Mia-Platform Software Catalog

In this release, weâ€™ve introduced the ability to edit items in the Software Catalog, providing more flexibility in resource management. Non-versioned items can now be fully edited, allowing users to modify all aspects of the item. For versioned items, only the metadata can be edited, while any changes to the resources will still require creating a new version.
