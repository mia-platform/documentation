## Console

### Bug Fix

This version address the following bugs:

- Fixed issue with project creation when the blueprint uses different values for `envPrefix` and `envId`.
Before this fix, the created project would have both values set to the same `envId` from the Company blueprint, while  `envPrefix` was not being applied correctly.

## How to update your Console

For self-hosted installations, please head to the [self hosted upgrade guide](/docs/13.x.x/infrastructure/self-hosted/installation-chart/how-to-upgrade) or contact your Mia-Platform referent and upgrade to _Console Helm Chart_ `v14.1.6`.
