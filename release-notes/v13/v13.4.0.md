## Manage your resources from Mia-Platform Software Catalog

In this release, we’ve enhanced the Software Catalog section with new features to improve resource management. Users can now create new items, as well as create new versions for items that support versioning, directly from the Console UI. Additionally, we’ve introduced the possibility to delete both individual items and their versions, offering more flexibility in managing resources within the Catalog. 

For more details, please refer to [the documentation](/docs/13.7.5/software-catalog/manage-items/software-catalog-ui/ui).

## Create versions for your Microservice Templates & Examples

You can now create and manage versions for Microservice Templates and Examples, enabling structured lifecycle management for these resource types as well.  
Users can easily view and instantiate Templates and Examples at a specific version within their configuration.

## Configuration Saved webhook

We have introduced the **Configuration Saved** webhook, which is triggered whenever the configuration for a Project is saved.  
You can easily enable it from the dedicated Webhook section in Console.

## Specificy the Rate limit for Endpoints' subroutes

For configurations using [Envoy API Gateway](/docs/13.7.5/runtime_suite/envoy-api-gateway/overview), you can now specify the rate limits for the subroutes of your Endpoints.  
This will allow for more granular control over rate limiting at the subroute level.

## Fine-Grained Access Control in Design section

:::info
This feature is currently available as a **Closed Preview**.  
For more information, head to the related [documentation page](/docs/13.7.5/development_suite/api-console/api-design/fine-grained-access-control) and contact your Mia-Platform referent to learn how to enable it.
:::

We have introduced a mechanism to restrict user actions in the Design section based on roles and predefined rules.   
Users with sufficient permissions can define granular rules to control access to specific actions, enhancing governance and security across Projects.
In this way, if a user attempts to perform a restricted action and save a configuration that violates such rules, the system will block the action and return an error message.

## Console

### Improvements

#### Monitoring of the Infrastructure Resources created from scratch

It is now possible, using the dedicated interface in the Design area, to define the parameters required to monitor an infrastructure resource created from scratch from the runtime area.

#### Changes to Extensions are shown immediately in the Console sidebar

We have improved the experience on managing the Extensions, making any changes made by the user immediately visible in the sidebar, with no need to manually refresh the page anymore.

#### Identities search case insensitive

We have enhanced the experience when searching for specific identities (Users, Service Accounts, Groups) within the Access Management section, making the search case insensitive.

### Bug Fix

This version addressed the following bugs:

* fixed a bug that made it impossible to change the type of a microservice environment variable from ‘Downward API’ to ‘Plain’;
* fixed a bug that made impossible to create a template without Kustomize
* fixed a bug that caused a wrong display of a company's cluster list has been corrected;

## Fast Data

### Fast Data Services

#### Projection Storer

The new version `v1.3.4` of the _Projection Storer_ is available!

#### Bug Fix

This version addressed a few bugs, here is a comprehensive list:

* following the upgrade of GraalJS version, insufficient permissions on the service image prevented the initialization of GraalVM cache and therefore the execution of any custom cast function. Now they can be properly executed again.
* the logic of provided cast function `castToDate` has been overhauled, so that dates represented as Unix timestamp in millisecond that ranges between `-2147483648` (`1969-12-07T03:28:36.352Z`) and `2147483647` (`1970-01-25T20:31:23.647Z`) are now properly converted into their expected date.

For more information check out the service [changelog](/docs/13.7.5/runtime_suite/projection-storer/changelog).
