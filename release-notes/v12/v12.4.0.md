## Console

### Webhook History

For each webhook configured on the Company, it is now possible to view the history of all its triggered events, with their respective status information, date and time, and body with the data that the Console sent.

### Define Rules for your Company & Projects

We have introduced a brand new tab named `Rules` where users with enough permissions can customize rules for their Company and its related Projects. This tab is present both at [Company](/docs/12.4.0/console/company-configuration/company-settings#rules) & [Project](/docs/12.4.0/console/project-configuration/project-settings#rules) level, inside the `Settings` section of each.

### Decide whether to ask for confirmation before saving or to perform a frictionless save

The first rule that we have introduced is dedicated to improve configuration save experience:  
starting from now, users with enough permission can decide whether to set a friction to ask for confirmation before saving in the Projects of a Company or to alternatively let users save their configuration in a quicker way when using the shortcut `Ctrl/Cmd + S`.

Please note that the rule is active by default on all existing Projects. To leverage the `Ctrl/Cmd + S` shortcut frictionless save experience you need to disable the rule.

For more information about the new Company Settings section, please refer to the related [documentation page](/docs/12.4.0/console/company-configuration/company-settings#rules).

### Improvements

#### Colored event labels in Flow Manager Configurator

In the [Flow Manager Configurator](/docs/12.4.0/development_suite/api-console/api-design/flow-manager-configurator/overview), event labels displayed in the canvas are colored and grouped according to the event group they belong to.
