## Fast Data Engine 2.0

We introduce the **Fast Data Engine 2.0**, a new suite of workloads designed to replace and significantly outperform traditional components for building Fast Data pipelines.

- **[Stream Processor](/docs/products/fast_data/fast_data_engine_v2/stream_processor/overview)** enables advanced and secure real-time data transformation, supporting both stateless and stateful processing for complex business logic
- **[Farm Data](/docs/products/fast_data/fast_data_engine_v2/farm_data/overview)** powers the core logic for building data products through high-performance multiple data stream aggregation
- **[Kango](/docs/products/fast_data/fast_data_engine_v2/kango/overview)** enables data product persistence from Kafka topics to MongoDB collections

Experience **up to 10x performance improvement** in aggregation operations, enabling scalable and efficient real-time Fast Data pipelines.

Discover all the benefits and capabilities of Fast Data Engine 2.0 in the [official documentation](/docs/products/fast_data/fast_data_engine_v2/overview).

## Enhanced Software Catalog Management Features

Weâ€™ve added new capabilities to improve Catalog item management and customization:

- support for adding **maintainers, useful links, labels,** and **annotations** to Catalog items;
- ability to map **relationships between existing Catalog items**, as well as define relationships with **custom entities**.

These features provide greater flexibility in organizing and enriching your Software Catalog.

Please refer to the [documentation](/docs/products/software-catalog/basic-concepts/items-relationships) for more information.
