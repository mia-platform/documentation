## Data Catalog Excel Add-in

The **Data Catalog Excel Add-in** seamlessly integrates with the Mia-Platform Data Catalog, enabling users to import asset metadata into Excel, perform bulk metadata enrichment into Excel spreadsheet, and synchronize updates back to the Catalog.  
This powerful add-in bridges the gap between Excel and the Data Catalog, simplifying large-scale metadata management while ensuring data quality and governance standards are maintained through pre-push validation and automatic error logging.
