## Data Catalog Excel Add-in

The **Data Catalog Excel Add-in** seamlessly integrates with the Mia-Platform Data Catalog, enabling users to import asset metadata into Excel, perform bulk metadata enrichment into Excel spreadsheet, and synchronize updates back to the Catalog.  
This powerful add-in bridges the gap between Excel and the Data Catalog, simplifying large-scale metadata management while ensuring data quality and governance standards are maintained through pre-push validation and automatic error logging.

:::note
The *Inheritance of Custom Properties* feature (Beta), first introduced in [RN v13.6.0](/release-notes/v13/v13.6.0.md#metadata-inheritance), has been officially **phased out** with the [latest service updates](/docs/products/data_catalog/data_catalog_compatibility_matrix#service-latest-versions) of the Data Catalog application.  
Its functionalities are now fully addressed and empowered by the new **Data Catalog Excel Add-in**, which offers a more intuitive and flexible way to propagate and manage custom properties across related assets.
