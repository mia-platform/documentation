This page shows the public roadmap of Mia-Platform. This is the result of our strategic vision and the collaboration of partners and stakeholder needs.

Our Roadmap is aimed at:

- keeping people working on the Product aligned on upcoming releases;
- planning contributions and support;
- planning the Project adoption;
- avoiding duplication of work;
- influencing the Roadmap itself.

## Future Work

Listed below you find which product features will be released in the following months.
Our Product is constantly evolving and every week we release new features, so it is possible that this list may not be always up-to-date.
On this page we keep you aligned on the most important issues:
