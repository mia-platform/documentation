If you want to customize the Fastify instance over the default settings that **lc39** will set
you can export a json object in your module:

```javascript
module.exports.options = {
  redact: {
    paths: ['supersecret', 'notread[*].here'],
    censor: '[YOUTRIED]',
  },
  trustProxy: '127.0.0.1',
  oasRefResolver: {
    buildLocalReference(json, baseUri, fragment, i) {
      // your naming convention
    }
  }
}
```

The values supported in this object are the supported keys and value for the Fastify server instance
that you can find at this [link][fastify-server-options]; with the exception of the `logger` parameter.  
Instead you can customize the `pino` instance via the `logLevel` key and you can modify the redaction rules
via the `redact` key. For this key the accepted values are listed [here][pino-redact-options].  
You have the following additional keys:
- `oasRefResolver` that is passed to the `fastify-swagger` plugin as `refResolver`; its usage can be found [here][fastify-swagger-refs].
