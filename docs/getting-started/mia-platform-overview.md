## Mia-Platform Overview: Accelerating Your Digital Future

In an ever-evolving digital landscape, speed of innovation, operational efficiency and the ability to leverage the true potential of data are fundamental for competitiveness. **Mia-Platform is your cloud-native Platform Builder for building and managing your custom digital platform**, designed to eliminate complexities and accelerate your journey towards digital excellence.

Developed **by developers for developers**, Mia-Platform consolidates all necessary tools into a single ecosystem, offering **guided paths ("golden paths")** through the complex landscape of cloud-native technologies. Our goal is simple: **simplify the software development lifecycle (SDLC)**, allowing you to focus on business logic rather than infrastructure.

### 1. Application Development: Develop Faster, with Intelligence

**The challenge:** Building scalable, reusable and performant cloud-native applications is often a slow and fragmented process, requiring an enormous amount of time and resources to manage underlying complexities.

**The Mia-Platform solution:** Mia-Platform transforms application development into a **self-service and AI-Native experience**. Forget bottlenecks and duplicated efforts. With Mia-Platform, you can:

* **Create modular and reusable microservices** with a few clicks, starting from predefined templates or importing them from an artifact registry, ensuring standardization and quality from day one.

* Leverage an **ever-expanding software catalog** (the Runtime Components) full of ready-to-use plugins, templates, and applications, drastically accelerating the development of your products.

* Design and orchestrate **Microfrontend Composer applications** (such as backoffices or complex user interfaces) in a few clicks, using low-code functionalities to read and write data in real-time.

* Manage the entire **end-to-end lifecycle of cloud-native applications** with full autonomy and security, from design to configuration, all the way to deployment.

**The result:** Increased productivity for development teams, reduced time-to-market and the freedom to innovate with agility, building applications that respond rapidly to business needs.

### 2. Platform Engineering: Industrialize Software Delivery with Governance

**The challenge:** Managing complex cloud-native infrastructures and ensuring a fluid Developer Experience (DevX) are arduous tasks that often heavily burden Platform Engineering and DevOps teams, increasing cognitive load and slowing down delivery.

**The Mia-Platform solution:** By enabling the construction of your **Internal Developer Platform (IDP)**, Mia-Platform allows you to industrialize software development and deployment. Through a Platform Engineering approach, Mia-Platform enables you to:

* **Reduce cognitive load** on cloud-native complexity, providing an abstract and intuitive environment for developers.

* **Define and manage environment variables** at different levels, with full control over user permissions and visibility, ensuring security and consistency.

* **Manage all configurations** of your microservices, abstracting their complexity thanks to powerful **low-code and no-code functionalities**.

* **Automate the deployment** of your microservices on **multi-cloud providers** and on-premise environments with a few clicks, monitoring their resource usage in real-time to optimize performance.

* **Expose all APIs** through an API Gateway of your choice, in a simple and secure way, ensuring controlled and governed access.

**The result:** Greater visibility, traceability and monitoring of the entire DevOps cycle. Your Platform Engineering teams can establish standards, ensure governance and make infrastructure transparent, allowing developers to focus on value creation.

### 3. Data Integration: Unlock the True Power of Your Data in Real-Time

**The challenge:** Integrating data from disparate sources, ensuring quality and real-time availability are common obstacles that prevent organizations from gaining a unified view and fully leveraging the value of their information assets.

**The Mia-Platform solution:** Mia-Platform allows you to build your **Digital Integration Hub (DIH)**, a cutting-edge solution as a reference implementation. This unique architecture combines the best of **Data Mesh** and **Data Fabric**, offering a holistic approach to data management. With Mia-Platform, you can:

* **Leverage a Data Fabric solution** to govern the entire data lifecycle, from collection to exposure.

* **Project data from your legacy systems** and create **Single Views**, unified views of a data subset with a specific purpose, to reduce access latency and increase data availability.

* **Connect your cloud-native platform** with existing systems, decoupling and offloading legacy systems, and serving real-time data 24/7.

* **Aggregate data from different sources** and make it available in near real-time, improving the availability and accessibility of crucial business information.

**The result:** Aggregated data available in real-time, a unified business view, and the ability to power strategic decisions and AI-native applications with always up-to-date information.
