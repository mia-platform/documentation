## Definition

In this scenario, we present the case where your architecture is composed by multiple Mia-Platform projects. Of course, you could think to treat each project as an independent entity and replicate, in each project, one of the scenarios presented so far.

For example, you could replicate [Scenario 2](/getting-started/tutorials/architecture/auth/external-idp.md) as in the following schema:
![Scenario 4](./img/auth-scenario4.png)

However, this replication brings some problems:
- The authentication service is replicated in every project. This is a waste of resources and it can also lead to problems when the service needs to be updated for some projects
- In such architecture, it is likely that a service of one project needs to call services of other projects using intra-cluster communication. In this case, the token resolution call would be needlessly repeated.  
- You may want to centralize the Ingresses management in a single namespace of your cluster. In this way it is easier to verify which are all the FQDNs connected to your Kubernetes clusters.

Therefore, we recommend to introduce in your architecture an `Edge Gateway` project that will be the entry point of all the incoming requests to your company and where you will centralize the token resolution flow.

![Scenario4a](./img/auth-scenario4a.png)

The picture above illustrates the architecture of a company composed by two projects and an `Edge Gateway` project.

The `Edge Gateway` contains the following microservices:
1. `API Gateway`: Mia-Platform plugin available in [Nginx](/runtime_suite/api-gateway/10_overview.md) or [Envoy](/runtime_suite/envoy-api-gateway/overview.md)
2. [`Authorization Service`](/runtime_suite/authorization-service/10_overview.md): Mia-Platform plugin
3. `Authentication Service`: a custom microservice that you need to implement. It must integrate with your external IdP to resolve the user token.

Each project contains the following microservices:
1. `API Gateway`: Mia-Platform plugin available in [Nginx](/runtime_suite/api-gateway/10_overview.md) or [Envoy](/runtime_suite/envoy-api-gateway/overview.md)
2. [`Authorization Service`](/runtime_suite/authorization-service/10_overview.md): Mia-Platform plugin
3. The microservice connected to the endpoint

The picture above illustrates the steps of the auth flow:  

1. The client, be it a web application or backend software, need to implement the authentication flow required by the IdP to obtain a valid token. With this token, the client will be able to call the endpoints of your project.
2. The client calls the endpoint of your project, including the valid token in the request. Usually this token is placed in the `Authorization` header but it can be placed in other headers or cookies.
3. The `API Gateway` of the `Edge Gateway` project calls the `Authorization Service` which, in turn, calls the `Authentication Manager` to resolve the token on the external IdP  
   
   :::note
   We suggest to avoid adding the user group expressions in the `Authorization Service` of the Edge Gateway but configuring them in the `Authorization Service` of the project.  
   In this way the project teams are autonomous in configuring the right group expression to secure their APIs.
   :::

5. The `Authentication Manager` resolves the token contacting the external IdP and returns the user payload to the `Authorization Service`
6. The `API Gateway` of the `Edge Gateway` forwards the HTTP request to tha `API Gateway` of right project. The request is decorated with the following HTTP header:
  
  | Header              | Description                                                                                |
  | --------------------| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | `Miausergroups`     | comma separated list of the groups the user belongs to                                     |
  | `Miauserid`         | the ID of the user                                                                         |
  | `Miauserproperties` | stringified JSON object containing the user payload returned by the Authentication Service |
7. The `Authorization Service` of the project verifies if the user who made the request is authorized to access to the requested endpoint. To do so, the `Authorization Service` will trust the HTTP headers above.
8. If the verification performed by the `Authentication Service` is successful, then the `API Gateway` forwards the original HTTP request the right microservice of the project.

## Tutorial steps

In the following tutorial we will specify all the steps to replicate the scenario depicted in the image above, i.e. an architecture with:
- 2 projects, `Project 1` and `Project 2`
- an `Edge Gateway`
- an external IdP

### Edge Gateway configuration

1. Create the `Edge Gateway` project following the [project creation documentation](/console/project-configuration/create-a-project.mdx)
2. Configure one [cross-project proxy](/development_suite/api-console/api-design/proxy.md#type-cross-projects) for each project
3. Create one endpoint for each cross-project proxy

  :::note
  When choosing the name of the endpoints consider that it will be the base path that will included in all the requests directed to a microservice of the project.  
  A possible naming convention could be `<HOST>/<project-name>/<endpoint>`
  :::

4. Configure the `API Gateway` to forward the HTTP headers resulting from the authentication flow (`Miauserid`, `Miausergroups`, `Miauserproperties`) to the projects' `API Gateway`
    - Follow [this guide](/development_suite/api-console/advanced-section/api-gateway/how-to.md#how-to-manage-authorization-in-a-multi-gateway-architecture) if you have Nginx API Gateway
    - Follow [this guide](/development_suite/api-console/advanced-section/api-gateway-envoy/jwt-authn.md) if you have Envoy API Gateway
5. Create an authentication manager as described in [Scenario 2](/getting-started/tutorials/architecture/auth/external-idp.md)

### Projects Configuration

:::note
We suppose that you have already created an API Gateway in your project and you already have some endpoints you want to securely expose through the Edge Gateway.
:::

1. Create the [`Authorization Service`](/runtime_suite/authorization-service/10_overview.md) plugin from Marketplace
    - This step can be done as described in [Scenario 2](/getting-started/tutorials/architecture/auth/external-idp.md)
    - The only important difference is that the `Authorization Service` must be configured in ["Trust Mia Headers" mode](/runtime_suite/authorization-service/30_usage.md#trust-mia-platform-user-headers) by setting the `TRUST_MIA_USER_HEADERS` environment variable to `true`
2. Secure your endpoint as described in [Scenario 2](/getting-started/tutorials/architecture/auth/external-idp.md)

### Centralize API Keys in the Edge Gateway

You can optionally choose to centralize in the Edge Gateway all the API keys.
1. Define your API Keys in the `Edge Gateway` as described in [Scenario 1](/getting-started/tutorials/architecture/auth/static-api-key.md)
2. Apply advanced configurations on the `API Gateway` of the `Edge Gateway` project 

<Tabs
  defaultValue="nginx"
  groupId="multi-project-tutorial"
  values={[
      { label: "API Gateway NGINX", value: "nginx", },
      { label: "API Gateway Envoy", value: "envoy", }
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="nginx">

Add the following Advanced Map Configuration to the `custom-maps-extension.conf` configuration.

```
map $secret_resolution $proxied_client_key {
  default "";
  "secreted" "secreted";
}
```

In this way, you are instructing your Nginx `API Gateway` to always forward to the projects' `API Gateway` the HTTP header `Client-Key=secreted`
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="envoy">

Define an Advanced Request Script in the `on-requests-script.yaml` where the API keys are manually translated into the `client-key` header.

```lua
- listener_name: frontend
  body: |+
    key_type_map = {
      ["<YOUR API KEY 1>"]={"all", "secreted"},
      ["<YOUR API KEY 2>"]={"all", "secreted"}
    }

    key = request_handle:streamInfo():dynamicMetadata():get("mia.metadata")["client_key"]

    if (key_type_map[key] ~= nil) then
      request_handle:streamInfo():dynamicMetadata():set("mia.metadata", "client_type", key_type_map[key][1])
      request_handle:streamInfo():dynamicMetadata():set("mia.metadata", "secret_resolution", key_type_map[key][2])
      request_handle:headers():replace("client-type", key_type_map[key][1])
      request_handle:headers():replace("client-key", key_type_map[key][2])
      request_handle:headers():replace("secret", key_type_map[key][2])
    else
      request_handle:streamInfo():dynamicMetadata():set("mia.metadata", "client_type", "")
      request_handle:streamInfo():dynamicMetadata():set("mia.metadata", "secret_resolution", "unsecreted")
      request_handle:headers():remove("client-key")
      request_handle:headers():remove("secret")
    end
```

In this way, you are instructing your Envoy `API Gateway` to always forward to the projects' `API Gateway` the HTTP header `Client-Key=secreted`

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

3. Define an API Key with the `secreted` value in all of your projects  

:::info
If you choose to centralize the API keys in the Edge Gateway project we suggest to have a project template with the `secreted` API key
