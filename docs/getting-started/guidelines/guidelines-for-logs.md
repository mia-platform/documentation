title:  Guidelines for logs
sidebar_label: Guidelines for logs
---
The objective of these guidelines is to guarantee uniformity between the logs from all services that run in a single project, regardless of whether they are custom or core.

## Log Parsers

When configuring a custom service you can select a _Log Parser_. Each log parser supports a specific logging format, but they all share the same purpose: allowing log collection and processing
from your Kubernetes cluster to the ELK Stack.

Mia-Platform Console provides a series of log parsers that can be selected from the Console and will be used to properly parse and process your service logs:

- `mia-json`: processes all logs as JSON, parsing all the keys to store them;
- `mia-nginx`: a custom Nginx parser;
- `mia-plain`: a plain text parser;
- _Not Collected_: prevents all logs from the Kubernetes Pod to be collected and processed.

## JSON Logging format

When a service uses the label with value `mia-json`, all of its key/values are collected and stored in Elastic. However, if you want to perform queries on the logs using Kibana, you'll need to create indexes.

A set of preconfigured indexes come with each Console project. These indexes run on a specific set of keys. The following document provides a list of available log keys (following the [Elastic Common Schema](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/index.html) specifications) that can be used. Some of these log keys are indexed.

:::info
Each project has a set of preconfigured indexes. If you need custom indexes, please refer to your Mia-Platform representative.
:::

Here you can find some guidelines, drawn from [guidelines and best practices suggested by Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/1.4/ecs-guidelines.html), which should be followed when application logs are generated:

- Field names must be in **camelCase**;
- Field names must not contain special characters;
- Field names should be singular or plural according to the content of the field;
- Whenever it makes sense, prefer nesting your fields in structured objects;
- Avoid using abbreviations in field names.

:::note
When creating a new server, consider offload the setup of the logging facilities to Mia-Platform service libraries:

- For **Node.js** services, you can use [lc39](https://github.com/mia-platform/lc39) and [custom-plugin-lib](https://github.com/mia-platform/custom-plugin-lib);
- For **Go** services, you can use [glogger](https://github.com/mia-platform/glogger).

### Use the appropriate logging level

It is important to always use the correct log level. Each level has a value expressed in tenths: the higher is the number, the higher the severity of the log.
To choose which is the appropriate level, you should rely on the following criteria:

| Name      | Severity | Description                                                                                                                                       |
| --------- | ---------| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `trace`   | 10       | Trace the operations flow of the application (do not use in production).                                                                  |
| `debug`   | 20       | Report information that may be useful in troubleshooting (do not use in production).                                                           |
| `info`    | 30       | In cases where the service has to give information about the branch of code in execution.                                                         |
| `warning` | 40       | In cases of recoverable error, the service can continue to process the request.                                                                   |
| `error`   | 50       | In cases of not recoverable error and error for which the processing of the request (but not the service) must be interrupted.                    |
| `fatal`   | 60       | In cases of unexpected and not recoverable error, and as a result of which the service must stop its execution.                                   |

It is important to put in logs the right information that can be used to track operations, highlight problems, and allow troubleshooting.

:::warning  
Avoid, under any circumstance, to insert any private or sensitive value that can lead to privacy-related issues or incidents.

### Mandatory Fields

In each log, the following fields have to be always present:

| Name    | Type   | Indexed |Description                                                                      |
| ------- | ------ | ------- |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `msg`   | String |  Indexed | The text message specific for each log.                                          |
| `reqId` | String |  Indexed | Traces the flow of each request. It is taken from the platform headers  |
| `time`  | Number |  Indexed | Marks in Unix timestamp the moment when the log was generated.                 |
| `level` | Number |  Indexed | Identifies the severity level of the log.                                        |

:::caution
The `reqId` field is extremely useful to trace operations following a single request, and is considered mandatory since usually services expose APIs.  
However, if the concept of request tracing is not applicable, you can ignore it.
:::

### Mandatory Logs

Each service exposing APIs must necessarily generate the logs shown in the table below, specifying the following fields in addition to the mandatory field specified above.

| Event             | Level   | Indexed | Field                                 |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Incoming request  | `trace` | Indexed | `host`, `url`                         |
| Request completed | `info`  | Indexed | `host`, `http`, `responseTime`, `url` |

:::note
If the service is not REST but takes its inputs from another source, the same criteria have to be applied.  
Use a `trace` log when the event processing starts, and a `info` log when the event ends.
The final log should contain as much useful information as possible.
:::

### ECS Field Definition

The following are examples taken from ECS documentation. None of the fields are mandatory, however it is important to use standard keys, whenever applicable.

#### Errors

If you want to create error logs, we recommend the following structure.
When an error log has been generated, the passed object must necessarily have the key `error`,
whose value has to be an object of the form specified by ECS for the [Error Fields](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/1.4/ecs-error.html),

| ---------------- | --------- | -------- | ------- |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
 | `url.domain`    | `keyword` | Extended | Indexed | Domain of the URL, such as [www.mia-platform.eu](https://www.mia-platform.eu/).         In some cases a URL may refer to an IP and/or port directly, without a domain name.    In this case, the IP address would go to the `domain` field.  Example: `www.mia-platform.eu`                                                                        |
 | `url.fragment`  | `keyword` | Extended | Indexed | Portion of the URL after the `#`, such as "top".      The `#` is not part of the fragment.   |
 | `url.full`      | `keyword` | Extended | Indexed | If full URLs are important to your use case, they should be stored in `url.full`, whether this field is reconstructed or present in the event source.             |
 | `url.full.text` | `text`    | Extended | Indexed | Multi-fields. Example: `https://www.elastic.co:443/search?q=elasticsearch#top`                       |
 | `url.path`      | `keyword` | Extended | Indexed | Path of the request, such as `/search`.                                                                                         |
 | `url.port`      | `long`    | Extended | Indexed | Port of the request, such as 443.      Example: `443`                                                                                    |
 | `url.query`     |  `keyword` | Extended | Indexed | The query field describes the query string of the request, such as "q=elasticsearch".     The `?` is excluded from the query string. If a URL contains no `?`, there is no query field. If there is a `?` but no query, the query field exists with an empty string. The `exists` query can be used to differentiate between the two cases. |
 | `url.scheme`    | `keyword` | Extended | Indexed | Scheme of the request, such as "https".      Note: The `:` is not part of the scheme.      Example: `https`.                      |
