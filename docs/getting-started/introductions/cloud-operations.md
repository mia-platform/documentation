# Cloud Operations

Cloud Operations encompass the practices and tools required to manage, monitor, and optimize complex multi-cloud and hybrid environments. The primary challenge is taming the inherent chaos of distributed systems, controlling operational overhead, enforcing security consistently, and optimizing costs without stifling innovation. Mia-Platform addresses these challenges by providing a centralized command center that masters cloud-native infrastructure, embedding best practices for security, reliability, and efficiency by default.

This approach transforms cloud infrastructure from a mere cost center into a strategic asset, enabling teams to manage complexity with ease, fortify their security posture, and drive both financial and environmental sustainability.

## Core Pillars of Cloud Operations with Mia-Platform

Mia-Platform empowers operations teams with a suite of tools and methodologies designed to provide full command over the cloud environment.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for Consistency

Mia-Platform champions the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) paradigm, allowing teams to manage and provision their entire infrastructure through machine-readable configurations. This ensures that every deployment is repeatable, scalable, and version-controlled.

* [**Infrastructure Projects**](/console/project-configuration/infrastructure-project)**:** A dedicated project type designed for Operations teams to define, version, and deploy infrastructure resources (like Kubernetes clusters, databases, or cloud storage) using tools such as Terraform or OpenTofu. This provides a consistent and controlled workflow for infrastructure changes.

* [**Custom Resources**](/console/design-your-projects/custom-resources/custom-resources)**:** Extend the Console's capabilities by defining any custom infrastructure object—from Kubernetes CRDs to serverless functions—as configuration-as-code elements, ensuring they are managed within the same governed lifecycle.

### Multi & Hybrid Cloud Fleet Command

From a single pane of glass, Mia-Platform allows you to control and orchestrate resources across multiple cloud providers and on-premises environments.

* [**Cluster Management**](/console/company-configuration/clusters-management/connect-and-manage-cluster)**:** Connect and manage any Kubernetes cluster, whether it's on a major cloud provider (GKE, EKS, AKS) or on-premise. This unified view simplifies the management of distributed infrastructure and enables true hybrid and multi-cloud flexibility.

### End-to-End Observability

Gaining deep, actionable insights into the health, performance, and security of your platform and applications is critical. Mia-Platform turns data into decisive operational intelligence.

* [**Integrated Monitoring and Logging**](/development_suite/monitoring/introduction)**:** The **Runtime Area** of the Console provides a real-time view of all deployed resources, including pods, deployments, and services. It offers direct access to logs, events, and resource metrics.

* [**Customizable Dashboards**](/development_suite/monitoring/dashboard)**:** Integrate and display dashboards from monitoring tools like Grafana and Kibana directly within the Console, providing a centralized view of application performance and system health.

* [**Alerting and Probes**](/development_suite/api-console/api-design/microservice-runtime-resources)**:** Configure liveness and readiness probes for your services to ensure Kubernetes can effectively manage their lifecycle, and set up alerting rules in tools like Grafana to be notified of issues proactively.

### Embedded Security and Guardrails

Security is not an afterthought but is embedded into the fabric of the platform. Mia-Platform enables the deployment of automated policies and controls that enforce security best practices system-wide.

* [**Automated Security Measures**](/infrastructure/paas/security-measures)**:** The platform enforces security by default with features like TLS encryption, centralized authentication and authorization flows, and vulnerability management.

* [**Fine-Grained Access Control**](/development_suite/api-console/api-design/authorization)**:** Utilize **Rönd**, a lightweight sidecar, to distribute security policy enforcement throughout your application, ensuring that access to sensitive data and operations is strictly controlled.

### Cloud Economics and Sustainability (FinOps & GreenOps)

Take command of your cloud spend and drive environmental sustainability by reducing the carbon footprint of your operations.

* [**Resource Optimization**](/console/tutorials/set-requests-limits-of-a-microservice)**:** The Console provides tools to set and monitor CPU and memory requests and limits for each microservice, preventing resource waste and optimizing costs.

* [**Automated Environment Shutdown with Kube-Green**](/infrastructure/paas/tools/kube-green)**:** Reduce the CO2 footprint of your clusters by automatically shutting down non-production environments (e.g., development, testing) during non-working hours, significantly cutting down on energy consumption and costs.

By adopting these Cloud Operations practices with Mia-Platform, organizations can achieve a state of operational excellence, managing complexity with confidence and transforming their infrastructure into a powerful engine for innovation.
