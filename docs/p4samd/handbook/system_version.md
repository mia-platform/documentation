# System Versions

## Overview
This table provides an overview of different system versions for the P4SaMD project, displaying their statuses, planned release dates, and relevant documentation. It helps users track development progress and access relevant information quickly.

## Configuration in Jira
The P4SaMD project is configured within **Jira**, where all versions and their details are managed. Each version in the table corresponds to a **Jira project version**, which means the data displayed is directly pulled from Jira. Updates to versions, such as their release, are managed within Jira and automatically reflected in this table.

## Quick Access to Last Worked Version
To streamline workflow efficiency, a **Quick Access** feature allows users to resume work on the last version they interacted with. Instead of manually selecting a version from the table every time, the system remembers the previously accessed version and automatically directs users to it when they return. This reduces the need for repeated selections and speeds up navigation within the version management process.

## Table Column Descriptions
- **Version**: The specific system version (e.g., 1.1.0, 1.0.1) as defined in Jira.
- **Start Date**: The date when work on this version began.
- **Planned Date**: The estimated release date of the version.<br/>

This documentation provides a structured approach to managing and accessing P4SaMD system versions efficiently, ensuring seamless tracking and development progress monitoring.
