## Installation

`miactl` can be installed in different ways, you can choose to one that better fits your needs:

- [Homebrew](#homebrew)
- [Go](#go)
- [Binary Download](#binary-download)
- [Docker Image](#docker)

### Homebrew

If you have [Homebrew] installed on your system `miactl` is only a command away:

```sh
brew install mia-platform/tap/miactl
```

### Go

If you have [Golang] installed with a version >= 1.13 in your system and you have the `$GOPATH`env set, you can
install `miactl` like this:

```sh
go install github.com/mia-platform/miactl@0.5.0
```

Or like this if the `install` command is not available

```sh
go get -u github.com/mia-platform/miactl@0.5.0
```

### Binary Download

You can install `miactl` with the use of `curl` or `wget` and downloading the latest packages available on GitHub
choosing the correct platform and operating system:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/mia-platform/miactl/releases/download/v0.5.0/miactl-linux-amd64 -o /tmp/miactl
```

```sh
wget -q https://github.com/mia-platform/miactl/releases/download/v0.5.0/miactl-linux-amd64 -O /tmp/miactl
```

After you have downloaded the file you can validate it against the checksum you can find at this [url] running the
command:

```sh
sha256sum /tmp/miactl
```

After you have validated that the downloaded file is correct, move the binary in your `/usr/local/bin` folder

```sh
chmod +x /tmp/miactl
mv /tmp/miactl /usr/local/bin
```

### Docker

If you want to run the cli in its environment or you want to test the cli you can use the Docker image:

```sh
docker run ghr.io/mia-platform/miactl@0.5.0 miactl
```

## Shell Autocompletion

Once you have installed the cli in your system you can setup the commands completion for one of this shells:

- [`bash`](#bash)
- [`zsh`](#zsh)
- [`fish`](#fish)

When you update the command remember to relaunch the command for your shell to update the completion definition
and get the latest command and/or flags that has been added.

### `bash`

The `bash` autocompletion needs the [`bash-completion`] package installed on your system.

**Warning:** for working correctly you need the `bash-completion` V2 that is compatible only with Bash 4.1+,
please be sure to have the correct versions installed on your system before running the command.

```sh
miactl completion bash >/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/miactl
```

After done this you must restart your shell environment or launch `exec bash` for reloading the configurations
and enable the autocompletion.

### `zsh`

For setting up the `zsh` completion, you must enable it. You can use the following command:

```sh
echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc
```

Or use something like [`oh-my-zsh`] that will enable it by default. Once you have done it you can launch the
following command to create the file needed by `zsh`:

```sh
miactl completion zsh > /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_miactl
```

After done this you must restart your shell environment or launch `exec zsh` for reloading the configurations and
enable the autocompletion.

### `fish`

To enable the autocompletion in `fish` you have to run this command:

```sh
miactl completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/miactl.fish
```

After done this you must restart your shell environment or launch `exec fish` for reloading the configurations and
enable the autocompletion.
