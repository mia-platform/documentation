<!-- 
  The description below must give a general idea about what `clients` do
-->

Clients manage interactions between the current page and other services. Typical use case encompasses http request managers,
data retrieval facilities from any given resource, CRUD services, and state stores. Clients components ensure isolation between
logical/business features and allow services encapsulation and adaption

## bk-crud-client

Manages http requests to a `MongoDB CRUD` service. Also it handles query mapping to conform to Mia's `CRUD` specifications.

:::info
This web component is designed to handle `CRUD` operations towards [Mia-Platform CRUD Service](../../../runtime_suite/crud-service/overview_and_usage).
:::

```html
<bk-crud-client></bk-crud-client>
```

### \__STATE__ life-cycle

In case `__STATE__` must be finely controlled upon creation/duplication/patching, some care must be taken while configuring.
As per `CRUD-Service` interface, `__STATE__` cannot be patched and requires a reserved endpoint call. Hence, no BO configuration
leads to patch with `__STATE__` included as part of the `$set` body.

`__STATE__` though can be tuned upon creation and duplication. The default behavior is

- on creation if not specified, `__STATE__` defaults to its CRUD collection default, i.e. no param is passed along with the HTTP request
- on duplication, to ensure backward compatibility, HTTP post is performed without `__STATE__` param defaulting again according with CRUD collections default

This behavior can be overridden using the `bk-crud-client` props `keepStateWhileDuplicating`.
If set to `true` it will carry along the `__STATE__` of the original item duplicating it as well.

A good configuration could be (in case `__STATE__` must be tunable by the user and carry duplication `__STATE__` along),

- in the `dataSchema`:

```json
{
  "__STATE__": {
    "type": "string",
    "label": "CRUD State",
    "default": "PUBLIC",
    "enum": ["PUBLIC", "DRAFT", "TRASH"],
    "formOptions": {
      "hiddenOnSelect": true
    },
    ...
  }
}
```

- in the `bk-crud-client`:

```json
{
  "type": "element",
  "tag": "bk-crud-client",
  "properties": {
    ...
    "keepStateWhileDuplicating": true,
    "dataSchema": {
      "$ref": "dataSchema"
    }
  }
}
```

### Data Deletion

By default, data deletion follows the [`__STATE__` pattern](../../../runtime_suite/crud-service/overview_and_usage#state-transitions) of `Mia-Platform CRUD Service`.

When `bk-crud-client` receives the [delete-data](../70_events.md#delete-data) event, it processes the payload to determine the appropriate action for the `__STATE__` field of the elements being deleted.
If the current `__STATE__` is PUBLIC or DRAFT, the `__STATE__` field is updated to TRASH; if the current `__STATE__` is TRASH it is updated to DELETED.

This behavior can be partially overridden using property `enableDefinitiveDelete`: it this is set to true, the elements in `__STATE__` TRASH will be irreversibly deleted from the collection.

Additionally, the bk-crud-client listens to the [http-delete](../70_events.md#http-delete) event. This event deletes the elements specified in the payload, regardless of their starting value of `__STATE__`.

The following table summarizes the outcomes based on different scenarios:

| Event           | Starting `__STATE__`     | `enableDefinitiveDelete` | Outcome                             |
|-----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `delete-data`   | `PUBLIC`/`DRAFT`         | false                    | `__STATE__` is updated to `TRASH`   |
| `delete-data`   | `TRASH`                  | false                    | `__STATE__` is updated to `DELETED` |
| `delete-data`   | `PUBLIC`/`DRAFT`         | true                     | `__STATE__` is updated to `TRASH`   |
| `delete-data`   | `TRASH`                  | true                     | element is permanently deleted      |
| `http-delete`   | `PUBLIC`/`DRAFT`/`TRASH` | -                        | element is permanently deleted      |


Both `delete-data` and `http-delete` also support bulk actions, in case payload is an array.

#### Example

- **delete-data**

  Assuming a [delete-data](../70_events.md#delete-data) event to be received with payload:
  ```json
  {
    "_id": "id-1",
    "__STATE__": "PUBLIC"
  }
  ```
  then the default behavior of `bk-crud-client` is to request the `__STATE__` field to be updated to TRASH for element with `id` "id-1".
  
  This consists in a POST call to `/state` of CRUD Service with payload:
  ```json
  {
    "filter": {"_id": "id-1"},
    "stateTo": "TRASH"
  }
  ```


- **delete-data (bulk)**

  Assuming a [delete-data](../70_events.md#delete-data) event to be received with payload:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "_id": "id-1",
      "__STATE__": "PUBLIC"
    },
    {
      "_id": "id-2",
      "__STATE__": "TRASH"
    }
  ]
  ```
  then the default behavior of `bk-crud-client` is to request the `__STATE__` field to be updated to TRASH for element with `id` "id-1" and to DELETED for element with `_id` "id-2".
  
  This consists in a POST call to `/state` of CRUD Service with payload:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "filter": {"_id": "id-1"},
      "stateTo": "TRASH"
    },
    {
      "filter": {"_id": "id-2"},
      "stateTo": "DELETED"
    }
  ]
  ```
- **enableDefinitiveDelete**

  Assuming a [delete-data](../70_events.md#delete-data) event to be received with payload:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "_id": "id-1",
      "__STATE__": "PUBLIC"
    },
    {
      "_id": "id-2",
      "__STATE__": "TRASH"
    }
  ]
  ```
  and `bk-crud-client` to configured like:
  ```json
  {
    "tag": "bk-crud-client",
    "payload": {
      "enableDefinitiveDelete": true
    }
  }
  ```
  then `bk-crud-client` requests the `__STATE__` field to be updated to TRASH for element with `id` "id-1" and to request permanent deletion of element with `_id` "id-2".
  
  This results in two http calls:
    - one POST to `/state` endpoint with payload
      ```json
      [
        {
          "filter": {"_id": "id-1"},
          "stateTo": "TRASH"
        }
      ]
      ```
    - one DELETE to `/id-2`

- **http-delete**

  Assuming an [http-delete](../70_events.md#http-delete) event to be received with payload:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "_id": "id-1",
      "__STATE__": "PUBLIC"
    },
    {
      "_id": "id-2",
      "__STATE__": "TRASH"
    }
  ]
  ```
  then `bk-crud-client` requests permanent deletion of elements with `_id` "id-1" and "id-2".
  
  This consists in a DELETE call to `/` with request:
  ```json
  {
    "_q": {
      "_id": {
        "$in":[
          "id-1",
          "id-2"
        ]
      }
    },
    "_st": "PUBLIC,TRASH"
  }
  ```

## bk-crud-lookup-client

resolves lookups from a given data schema onto a given source

```html
<bk-crud-lookup-client></bk-crud-lookup-client>
```

### Description

The `bk-crud-lookup-client` provides support to resolve `lookups`. The provided behavior is quite
alike to SQL join resolution, but on a frontend client.

Let's say our data schema, as JSON schema description, looks like:

```json
{
  "$defs": {
    ...,
    "city": {
      "type": "string",
      "lookupOptions": {
        "lookupDataSource": "cities",
        "lookupValue": "_id",
        "lookupFields": ["name"]
      }
    }
  },
  "dataSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "_id": "#/$defs/_id",
      "city": "#/$defs/city",
      "addresses": {
        "type": "array",
        "items": {
          "address1": "#/$defs/address1",
          "city": "#/$defs/city"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

hence `city` is a lookup from another collection called by both first and second level of
an item described by the previous data schema.

`bk-crud-lookup-client` will perform a recursive analysis on the data schema. Starting from a given data sample

```json
[
  {
    "_id": "1",
    "city": "city_1",
    "addresses": [
      {
        "address1": "12 Byron St.",
        "city": "city_124"
      },
      {
        "address1": "1 Batman Rd.",
        "city": "city_124"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

it will fetch a projection `lookupFields` of `lookupDataSource`

```
city_1 -> Sydney
city_124 -> Melbourne
```

and emit a `lookup-data` event with a resolved partial data structure as payload

```json
[
  {
    "city": "Sydney",
    "addresses": [
      {
        "city": "Melbourne"
      },
      {
        "city": "Melbourne"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

such structure can be compared with the original datum, which is not modified.

## bk-export

crud-service export webcomponent

```html
<bk-export></bk-export>
```

<!-- 
  ## bk-export
-->

`bk-export` __extends__ `back-kit-engine`'s BkHttpBase

`bk-export` client is a business-logic webcomponent that handles the export of an entire collection from a backend CRUD-service resource.
It works as `ndjson` fetcher as well as native file downloader which uses browser download native API.

If export must be performed on a [CRUD-service] resource, an export route is available at `<collection-name>/export` and supports
mongoDB queries as per CRUD-service specifications, along with `__STATE__` filtering.

`bk-export` listens to any filtering done on the plugin is mounted in by accessing any [change-query](../events#change-query) event
and by keeping an internal representation of all applied filter.

`bk-export` listens also to an [export-data](../events#export-data) which triggers a http GET request.

Export modes are controlled by the boolean prop `nativeDownload`:

- when `false`, it performs an http GET and parses the content as ndjson
- when `true`, it delegates to the browser API by creating and clicking an anchor tag with the url specified by the `basePath` property

:::caution

in order to handle large sized file, on CRUD export data, a service worker is registered to perform local storage persistance operations instead of using large chunks of memory. To do so an external [resource] is needed. You can also use the same resource hosted with `back-kit` JS bundle available at `<back-kit endpoint>/export-service-worker.html`.
In the latter case set `streamSaverIFrameSrc` to the resource endpoint

:::

`bk-export` emits [success](../events#success) or [error](../events#error) events after the export is triggered. The events are emitted after the export is over (or on failure) if `nativeDownload` is set to `false`, or after the download request has been issued otherwise.

## bk-export-client

Frontend client for mia's [Export Service](../../../runtime_suite/export-service/overview)

```html
<bk-export-client></bk-export-client>
```

This component implements the `Export Service` interface on top of `fetch` http client on the browser.

It listens the `EventBus` to record the current state of the page:

1. filters and query changes (that modify data shown by the `bk-crud-client`)
2. counts the currently filtered items
3. counts and records the user selection on a table

According with `Export Service` it provides 2 modes:

1. CSV
2. Excel

To open an export transaction it listens to an `export-data` event and return an `export-data/awaiting-config`
event which carries along the following payload

```typescript
export type AwaitUserConfig = {
  total?: number
  selected?: number
  columns: Option[]
}
```

where `total` is the last count of queried items, `selected` is the count of currently selected items and
`columns` are selectable columns from the `DataSchema`

a `Meta` contains the `transactionId` and must be re-cast when options are selected. An `export-data/user-config`
event must then follow with payload

```typescript
export type ExportUserConfig = {
  exportType: 'csv' | 'xlsx'
  csvSeparator?: 'COMMA' | 'SEMICOLON'
  filters: 'all' | 'filtered' | 'selected'
  columns: string[]
}
```

Once the config is received, the http client calls the `Export Service` and the download is completed natively by
a service worker registered within the browser. The UI is not locked.

To allow notifications in case of failure an `error` event is triggered.
Add to `bk-notifications` the following error trigger

```json
{
  ...,
  "errorEventMap": {
    "export-data": {
      "title": "Error",
      "content": "An error occurred while exporting data"
    },
    ...
  }
}
```

## bk-file-manager

Manages file upload transactions by holding a unique transaction ID hash map. Since files are often linked to a collection entry but stored on a different service, it might be handy to control file upload through a transaction manager. Two steps are needed to successfully upload a file:

1. file upload to storage service (handled by [file-client](#file-client))
2. update CRUD collection (handled by [crud-client](#file-client))

Events marked as *transaction required* must carry a `meta` property with a registered `transactionId`.
