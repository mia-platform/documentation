## bk-dynamic-form-card

Generic card with a form body and a footer with actions that can be executed on the form values.
By default, allows to edit or create items described by the `dataSchema`, once data is submitted for creation or update.
Custom behavior can be furthermore specified, allowing extra actions to be included in card footer via buttons.

```html
<bk-dynamic-form-modal></bk-dynamic-form-card>
```

![form-card](../img/bk-form-card.png)

`bk-dynamic-form-card` is used to display a card containing a Form to edit or create items described by the `dataSchema`.

The card listens to [display-data](../70_events.md#display-data) event to initialize its form.
The form operates in two different modes:

- *insert*, by setting property `submitBehavior` to "add"
- *edit*, by setting property `submitBehavior` to "edit"

### Modes

#### Insert

When the component reacts to the `add-new` event it opens the form with the initial values specified in the payload of the event. By clicking on the action button of the card footer, the event `createData` is emitted with payload equal to the object representation of the form values. This event requests the upload of a new item, and is listened by components such as [bk-crud-client](./30_clients.md#bk-crud-client).
If the form contains files, the component emits a `createDataWithFile`, event where payload contains all the data of the form, including files. A component like [bk-file-manager](./30_clients.md#bk-file-manager) should listen to this event and initialize a transaction to create the new item as well as upload the new file to a bucket.
A `transactionId` is added to the meta field of the emitted event to handle possible errors.

#### Edit

When the component reacts to the `selected-data` event it opens the form with the initial values specified in the payload of the event. By clicking on the action button of the card footer, the event `updateData` is emitted with payload equal to the object representation of the form values. This event requests the update of an existing item, and is listened by components such as [bk-crud-client](./30_clients.md#bk-crud-client).
If the form contains new files, the component emits a `updateDataWithFile`, event where payload contains all the data of the form, including files. A component like [bk-file-manager](./30_clients.md#bk-file-manager) should listen to this event and initialize a transaction to update the new item as well as upload the new file to a bucket.
A `transactionId` is added to the meta field of the emitted event to handle possible errors.

### Dynamic Context

Several properties of `bk-dynamic-form-card` allow [dynamic configurations](../40_core_concepts.md#dynamic-configuration). By default, such properties are parsed with [handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/expressions.html) injecting the current state of the form as context through key `values`, as well as other information.

```typescript
{
  values: Record<string, any>
  currentUser: Record<string, any> // information on currently logged user, if available
}
```

### After Submission

When done filling up the form, usually `bk-dynamic-form-card` performs an `update-data` or `create-data` according to the operation invoked to open it (either `add-new` or `select-data`). Usually an http-like client takes care of these operations.
It is often useful to perform other tasks upon creation or editing.
Properties `onSuccess` and `onFail` allow to append an [action](../50_actions.md) to the successful or unsuccessful submission of the form. It is also possible to scope actions based on what [mode](#modes) the form is operating under.

In the following example, a single action is configured to be executed upon successful data data creation or update, while two different actions are specified for the case of failure.
```json
{
  "onSuccess": {
    "type": "push",
    "config": {
      "url": "/some-url" // on successful form submission, a navigation action to `/some-url` is performed
    }
  },
  "onFail": {
    "insert": {
      "type": "push",
      "config": {
        "url": "/insert-mode-error" // on UNsuccessful data creation, a navigation action to `/insert-mode-error` is performed
      }
    },
    "select": {
      "type": "push",
      "config": {
        "url": "/edit-mode-error" // on successful form submission, a navigation action to `/edit-mode-error` is performed
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Form context can be used in `onSuccess` and `onFail` properties using `handlebars` notation, allowing [dynamic configurations](../40_core_concepts.md#dynamic-configuration). Actions specified with `onSuccess` and `onFail` are parsed with handlebars, injecting the [default context](#dynamic-context), as well as the response of the submission request:

```typescript
{
  currentUser: Record<string, any>
  values: Record<string, any>
  response: Record<string, any>
}
```

where `values` is the form state and `response` contains a JS object which is the content of the `eventBusSuccess` payload linked to the form submission request (either `create-data` or `update-data`).

### Footer Buttons

By deafult, a submit button and a cancel button are included in the card footer. the first one emits a `create-data` or `update-data` event, while the first one resets values to their initial values.

#### Extra buttons

Other than default buttons, extra buttons can be specified to be included in the card footer. These can be configured with property `actions`.
However, actions can be scoped depending on the card operating [mode](#modes).

Property `actions` thus has type:
```typescript
{
  ButtonWithClose[] | {
    insert: ButtonWithClose[]
    select: ButtonWithClose[]
    }
}
```
where
```typescript
type ButtonWithClose = Partial<BkButton> & { closeAfter?: boolean }
```

Actions support [dynamic configurations](../40_core_concepts.md#dynamic-configuration) and are injected with the [default context](#dynamic-context) of the component, which includes the current form values through `values` keyword.

For instance:
```json
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "content": "Action GET",
      "action": {
        "type": "http",
        "config": {
          "url": "/some-endpoint",
          "method": "GET"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "content": "Action POST",
      "action": {
        "type": "http",
        "config": {
          "url": "/some-endpoint",
          "method": "POST",
          "body": "{{rawObject values}}"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

A `bk-dynamic-form-card` that were provided with such `actions` property will add three buttons to the footer of the card, other than the default button for submission:
  - a button with `Action GET` label which performs a GET request to specified endpoint
  - a button with `Action POST` label which performs a POST request to specified endpoint with an object representation of current form values as payload

#### Omitting default buttons

It is possible to omit the default submission and cancel buttons by setting property `omitSubmit` and `omitCancel` to true.


### Confirmation dialog on save and on close

It is possible to ask for confirmation on close and/or on save, and also customize the dialog texts.

It can be done using the `requireConfirmation` property. It accepts three different values and it is defaulted as `false`:

#### 1. Boolean type

It can be set as `true` to open the dialog on close or as `false` otherwise.

#### 2. Object of type RequireConfirmOpts

An object such as:
```typescript
{
  cancelText?: any; // cancel button text
  okText?: any; // ok button text
  content?: any; // the content text
  title?: any; // the title text
}
```
to customize the dialog texts. They can also be localized, passing an object containing the language acronyms key and the text as value, for example:

```json
{
  "content": {
    "it": "Verrà creato un nuovo elemento, procedere?",
    "en": "A new element will be created, continue?"
  }
}
```

### Integrate custom labels

Custom labels can be specified as localized objects, controlling card title, CTA button label, require confirm message.
Such labels can be scoped based on whether the form is in [edit or create](#modes) mode.

```json
{
  "tag": "bk-dynamic-form-card",
  "properties": {
    ...
    "customLabels": {
      "create": {
        "title": {
          "en": "Add new order",
          "it": "Aggiungi nuovo ordine"
        },
        "ctaLabel": {
          "en": "Submit",
          "it": "Submit Order"
        },
        "cancelButton": {
          "en": "Cancel",
          "it": "Cancel"
        },
        "unsavedChangesContent": {
          "en": "Closing now will discard new order, do you want to continue?",
          "it": "Chiudendo ora si perderà l'ordine non salvato, procedere?"
        },
        "saveChangesContent": {
          "en": "A new order will be created, continue?",
          "it": "Verrà creato un nuovo ordine, procedere?"
        }
      },
      "update": {
        "title": {
          "en": "Order detail",
          "it": "Dettaglio ordine"
        },
        "ctaLabel": {
          "en": "Update Order",
          "it": "Salva Ordine"
        },
        "cancelButton": {
          "en": "Cancel",
          "it": "Cancel"
        },
        "unsavedChangesContent": {
          "en": "Closing now will discard changes to the order, do you want to continue?",
          "it": "Chiudendo ora si perderanno tutte le modifiche non salvate all'ordine, procedere?"
        },
        "saveChangesContent": {
          "en": "The order will be updated, continue?",
          "it": "L'ordine sarà modificato, procedere?"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Not all keys need to be specified, as `customLabels` is merged with default labels. For instance, the following is a valid configuration of `customLabels`:
```json
{
  "tag": "bk-dynamic-form-card",
  "properties": {
    ...
    "customLabels": {
      "create": {
        "title": {
          "en": "Add new order",
          "it": "Aggiungi nuovo ordine"
        }
      },
      "update": {
        "title": {
          "en": "Order details",
          "it": "Dettaglio ordine"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### File fields with meta-data

Fields that are of type `object` or `array`, have the format `file`, and include a `dataSchema` or `items` property are displayed within the form.
In this scenario, `dataSchema` and `items` properties are used to determine the shape of the metadata associated with the file.

These fields are rendered with a link plus a button that triggers components [bk-file-picker-modal](#bk-file-picker-modal) or [bk-file-picker-drawer](#bk-file-picker-drawer) to spawn, if included in the plugin configuration. Clicking on these buttons opens up the respective components, enabling interaction with the uploaded files and allowing for the modification of their metadata.

### Working with Views

`bk-dynamic-form-card` can be used with data from (Mia-Platform CRUD Service views) [../../runtime_suite/crud-service/writable_views].

#### Lookups

Fields described inside the `dataSchema` as having type `object` or `array` and format `lookup` are rendered as select or multi-select respectively.

Options for such fields will be dynamically fetched from the endpoint specified in `basePath` property, using `/lookup` route provided by the `CRUD service`, which returns a list of objects. Each option fetched like this should have at least a `label` field, which is used as display value inside the form, and a `value` field which is used as unique identifier for such option.

The form stores selected values for lookup fields in their whole (not just `label` and `value` fields). Extra fields are thus available in submit payload, as well as in form [context](#dynamic-context).

Extra queries can be specified to be applied when fetching options using property `lookupQueries`, which maps lookup fields to [queries](../40_core_concepts.md#inline-queries).

```typescript
type LookupQueries: {
  [property: string]: Record<string, unknown> | Record<string, unknown>[]
}
```

For instance, given the following value for `lookupQueries`:
```json
{
  "lookupQueries": {
    "dishes": {
      "calories": {
        "$lt": 300
      }
    }
  }
}
```
options will be fetched form `/lookup/dishes` route with extra condition that "calories" field of dishes collection should be lower than 300.

Dynamic queries are also available, being provided with [form context](#dynamic-context):
```json
{
  "lookupQueries": {
    "dishes": {
      "calories": {
        "$lt": "{{rawObejct maxCalories}}" // rawObject can be used to prevent numeric values from being stringified
      }
    }
  }
}
```
in this case, form field "maxCalories" is used to dynamically compute the query to be used when fetching options.

#### Writable views

`POST` and `PATCH` methods are supported by writable views, and expect the whole object as body of the request. To perform such actions, instead of the default creation or update, it is possible to leverage the `actions` property of the component to include [extra buttons](#extra-buttons).

The following example shows a configuration of `bk-dynamic-form-card` designed to interact with writable views:

```json
{
  "tag": "bk-dynamic-form-card",
  "properties": {
    "dataSchema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "name": {"type": "string"},
        "rider": {"type": "object", "format": "lookup"} // lookup field, will be rendered as a select field
      }
    },
    "basePath": "/orders-view", // `/orders-view/lookup/rider` will provide a list of options for rider field
    "omitSubmit": true, // omits default submit button, which is designed to follow standard CRUD collections interface
    "actions": {
      "insert": { // performs POST request to `/orders-view/` endpoint with form values as body
        "content": "Add order",
        "type": "primary",
        "action": {
          "type": "http",
          "config": {
            "url": "/orders-view/",
            "method": "POST",
            "body": "{{rawObject values}}"
          }
        }
      },
      "select": { // performs PATCH request to `/orders-view/` endpoint with form values as body
        "content": "Update order",
        "type": "primary",
        "action": {
          "type": "http",
          "config": {
            "url": "/orders-view/",
            "method": "PATCH",
            "body": "{{rawObject context}}"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```


### Conditional Fields

#### Conditionally hide/disable fields

Property `conditionalOptions` allows to specify dynamic conditions for specific extra [form-options](../30_page_layout.md#form-options) to be applied. This allows to dynamically hide, set to readonly, disable fields based on other fields within the form.

Property `conditionalOptions` expects an array of objects with fields:
  - `property`: id of the target field to which extra form-options might be applied
  - `query`: the MongoDB-like [query](../40_core_concepts.md#inline-queries) to be used against current form values in order to establish whether or not to apply the extra form-options to the target field. If the query condition is satisfied by the current form values, form-options are applied. Note that dynamic values can be used to compare values of two entries of the form, via the [context injected](#dynamic-context) by the form.
  - `option`: the form-options value to be dynamically injected to the target field

Updating form fields triggers new evaluation of the conditional options, thus updating the form fields accordingly when necessary.

```typescript
type ConditionalOption: {
  property: string
  query: Record<string, unknown>
  option: RHDOptions
}

type RHDOptions = {
    hidden?: boolean;
    hiddenOnUpdate?: boolean;
    hiddenOnInsert?: boolean;
  } & {
    readOnly?: boolean;
    readOnlyOnUpdate?: boolean;
    readOnlyOnInsert?: boolean;
  } & {
    disabled?: boolean;
    disabledOnUpdate?: boolean;
    disabledOnInsert?: boolean;
  }
```

For instance:
```json
{
  "conditionalOptions": [
    {
      "property": "items",
      "query": {
        "budget": {
          "$lt": "{{rawObject values.totalPrice}}" // dynamic queries can be used to compare values of two entries of the form. In this case, `budget` is compared to `totalPrice`. `rawObject` helper can be used to avoid numeric fields to be stringinfied.
        }
      },
      "option": {
        "disable": true
      }
    },
    {
      "property": "isGift",
      "query": {
        "$or": [
          {"status": {"$eq": "OutOfStock"}},
          {"budget": {"$lt": "{{rawObject context.totalPrice}}"}}
        ]
      },
      "option": {
        "hidden": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Using such configuration, field "items" is disabled once field "budget" is lower than field "totalPrice":

```json
{
  "items": ["fork", "spoon", "napkins"],
  "totalPrice": 15,
  "budget": 7
}
```

Once "budget" field is updated to "20", field "items" is no longer disabled.


#### Conditionally reset fields value

For each field it is possible to specify dynamic validity conditions which depend on other fields of the form using the property `conditionalValues`. Fields that do not meet specified conditions have their value reset.

Property `conditionalValues` expects an array of objects with fields:
  - `property`: id of the target field of which to check the value
  - `query`: the MongoDB-like [query](../40_core_concepts.md#inline-queries) to be used against current form values in order to establish whether or not to reset the value of the target field. As long as the query condition is satisfied by the current form values, the field value is considered valid. Once this is no longer the case, the field value is reset. Note that dynamic values can be used to compare values of two entries of the form, via the [context injected](#dynamic-context) by the form.

Updating form fields triggers new evaluation of the conditional values, thus updating the form fields accordingly when necessary.

:::info
Each entry of an array field is singularly matched against the query. Only invalid entries are removed from the array value.
:::

```typescript
type ConditionalOption: {
  property: string
  query: Record<string, unknown>
}
```

```json
{
  "conditionalValues": [
    {
      "property": "city",
      "query": {
        "city.countryName": {
          "$eq": "country" // `city` is an object field with a `countryName` key. If city.countryName is not equal to the value of `country` form field, `city` field is reset.
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "property": "dishes", // dishes is an array. Each entry of dishes is singularly matched against the query!
      "query": {
        "calories": {
          "$lt": "{{rawObject context.maxCalories}}" // assuming dishes is an array of objects, entries of dishes that have a field `calories` grater than the current value of form field `maxCalories` will be automatically removed from the dishes array. Helper `rawObject` is used to avoid numeric values from being stringified
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

For instance, the following form values are valid according to the above configuration:
```json
{
  "country": "Italy",
  "city": {
    "name": "Milano",
    "countryName": "Italy"
  },
  "dishes": [
    {"name": "Tomato", "calories": 30}, 
    {"name": "Pudding", "calories": 300}, 
  ],
  "maxCalories": 400,
}
```

If the value of field "country" were to be updated to "France", the value of "city" field would be reset, since the first entry of `conditionalValues` would be no longer met:
```json
{
  "country": "France",
  // "city" field is now undefined
  "dishes": [
    {"name": "Tomato", "calories": 30}, 
    {"name": "Pudding", "calories": 300}, 
  ],
  "maxCalories": 400,
}
```

If, furthermore, the value of field "maxCalories" were to be updated to "200", the value of "dishes" field would be updated, resulting in one entry being reset:
```json
{
  "country": "France",
  "dishes": [
    {"name": "Tomato", "calories": 30}
  ],
  "maxCalories": 200,
}
```
Note how each entry of array fields is singularly matched against the query. Only invalid entries are removed from the array value.

## bk-dynamic-form-drawer

Generic drawer with a form body and a footer with actions that can be executed on the form values.
By default, allows to edit or create items described by the `dataSchema`, once data is submitted for creation or update.
Custom behavior can be furthermore specified, allowing extra actions to be included in drawer footer via buttons.

```html
<bk-dynamic-form-modal></bk-dynamic-form-drawer>
```

![form-drawer](../img/bk-form-drawer.png)

`bk-dynamic-form-drawer` is used to display a drawer containing a Form to edit or create items described by the `dataSchema`.

The drawer can be opened in two different modes:

- *insert*, by listening the `add-new` event
- *edit*, by listening the `selected-data` event

### Modes

#### Insert

When the component reacts to the `add-new` event it opens the drawer with the initial values specified in the payload of the event. By clicking on the action button of the drawer footer, the event `createData` is emitted with payload equal to the object representation of the form values. This event requests the upload of a new item, and is listened by components such as [bk-crud-client](./30_clients.md#bk-crud-client).
If the form contains files, the component emits a `createDataWithFile`, event where payload contains all the data of the form, including files. A component like [bk-file-manager](./30_clients.md#bk-file-manager) should listen to this event and initialize a transaction to create the new item as well as upload the new file to a bucket.
A `transactionId` is added to the meta field of the emitted event to handle possible errors.

#### Edit

When the component reacts to the `selected-data` event it opens the drawer with the initial values specified in the payload of the event. By clicking on the action button of the drawer footer, the event `updateData` is emitted with payload equal to the object representation of the form values. This event requests the update of an existing item, and is listened by components such as [bk-crud-client](./30_clients.md#bk-crud-client).
If the form contains new files, the component emits a `updateDataWithFile`, event where payload contains all the data of the form, including files. A component like [bk-file-manager](./30_clients.md#bk-file-manager) should listen to this event and initialize a transaction to update the new item as well as upload the new file to a bucket.
A `transactionId` is added to the meta field of the emitted event to handle possible errors.

### Dynamic Context

Several properties of `bk-dynamic-form-drawer` allow [dynamic configurations](../40_core_concepts.md#dynamic-configuration). By default, such properties are parsed with [handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/expressions.html) injecting the current state of the form as context through key `values`, as well as other information.

```typescript
{
  values: Record<string, any>
  currentUser: Record<string, any> // information on currently logged user, if available
}
```

### After Submission

When done filling up the form, usually `bk-dynamic-form-drawer` performs an `update-data` or `create-data` according to the operation invoked to open it (either `add-new` or `select-data`). Usually an http-like client takes care of these operations.
It is often useful to perform other tasks upon creation or editing.
Properties `onSuccess` and `onFail` allow to append an [action](../50_actions.md) to the successful or unsuccessful submission of the form. It is also possible to scope actions based on what [mode](#modes) the drawer is operating under.

In the following example, a single action is configured to be executed upon successful data data creation or update, while two different actions are specified for the case of failure.
```json
{
  "onSuccess": {
    "type": "push",
    "config": {
      "url": "/some-url" // on successful form submission, a navigation action to `/some-url` is performed
    }
  },
  "onFail": {
    "insert": {
      "type": "push",
      "config": {
        "url": "/insert-mode-error" // on UNsuccessful data creation, a navigation action to `/insert-mode-error` is performed
      }
    },
    "select": {
      "type": "push",
      "config": {
        "url": "/edit-mode-error" // on successful form submission, a navigation action to `/edit-mode-error` is performed
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Form context can be used in `onSuccess` and `onFail` properties using `handlebars` notation, allowing [dynamic configurations](../40_core_concepts.md#dynamic-configuration). Actions specified with `onSuccess` and `onFail` are parsed with handlebars, injecting the [default context](#dynamic-context), as well as the response of the submission request:

```typescript
{
  currentUser: Record<string, any>
  values: Record<string, any>
  response: Record<string, any>
}
```

where `values` is the form state and `response` contains a JS object which is the content of the `eventBusSuccess` payload linked to the form submission request (either `create-data` or `update-data`).

### Footer Buttons

#### Extra buttons

Other than default submit button, extra buttons can be specified to be included in the drawer footer. These can be configured with property `actions`.
By default, property `action` expects an array of objects, each shaped like properties of a [bk-button](./20_buttons.md#bk-button) component, with the additional property `closeAfter`, which controls whether or not the drawer should be closed after the action is performed (defaults to true).
However, actions can be scoped depending on the drawer opening [mode](#modes).

Property `actions` thus has type:
```typescript
{
  ButtonWithClose[] | {
    insert: ButtonWithClose[]
    select: ButtonWithClose[]
    }
}
```
where
```typescript
type ButtonWithClose = Partial<BkButton> & { closeAfter?: boolean }
```

Actions support [dynamic configurations](../40_core_concepts.md#dynamic-configuration) and are injected with the [default context](#dynamic-context) of the component, which includes the current form values through `values` keyword.

For instance:
```json
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "content": "Cancel"
    },
    {
      "content": "Action GET",
      "action": {
        "type": "http",
        "config": {
          "url": "/some-endpoint",
          "method": "GET"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "closeAfter": false,
      "content": "Action POST",
      "action": {
        "type": "http",
        "config": {
          "url": "/some-endpoint",
          "method": "POST",
          "body": "{{rawObject values}}"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

A `bk-dynamic-form-drawer` that were provided with such `actions` property will add three buttons to the footer of the drawer, other than the default button for submission:
  - a button with `Cancel` label which simply closes the drawer
  - a button with `Action GET` label which performs a GET request to specified endpoint, and closes the drawer afterwards
  - a button with `Action POST` label which performs a POST request to specified endpoint with an object representation of current form values as payload, without closing the drawer afterwards

#### Omitting submit button

It is possible to omit the default submission button by setting property `omitSubmit` to true.

### Confirmation dialog on save and on close

It is possible to ask for confirmation on close and/or on save, and also customize the dialog texts.

It can be done using the `requireConfirmation` property. It accepts three different values and it is defaulted as `false`:

#### 1. Boolean type

It can be set as `true` to open the dialog on close or as `false` otherwise.

#### 2. Object of type RequireConfirmOpts

An object such as:
```typescript
{
  cancelText?: any; // cancel button text
  okText?: any; // ok button text
  content?: any; // the content text
  title?: any; // the title text
}
```
to customize the dialog texts. They can also be localized, passing an object containing the language acronyms key and the text as value, for example:

```json
{
  "content": {
    "it": "Verrà creato un nuovo elemento, procedere?",
    "en": "A new element will be created, continue?"
  }
}
```

#### 3. Object of type RequireConfirmForm

An object such as:
```typescript
{
  onSave: boolean | RequireConfirmOpts
  onClose: boolean | RequireConfirmOpts
}
```
which is the only way to enable the confirmation dialog on save.

Both `onSave` and `onClose` must be passed in the configuration and both of them accept a `boolean` or a `RequireConfirmOpts` type with the same rules written above in points 1 and 2 of this section. 

### Integrate custom labels

Custom labels can be specified as localized objects, controlling drawer title, CTA button label, require confirm message.
Such labels can be scoped based on whether the form is in [edit or create](#modes) mode.

```json
{
  "tag": "bk-dynamic-form-drawer",
  "properties": {
    ...
    "customLabels": {
      "create": {
        "title": {
          "en": "Add new order",
          "it": "Aggiungi nuovo ordine"
        },
        "ctaLabel": {
          "en": "Submit",
          "it": "Submit Order"
        },
        "cancelButton": {
          "en": "Cancel",
          "it": "Cancel"
        },
        "unsavedChangesContent": {
          "en": "Closing now will discard new order, do you want to continue?",
          "it": "Chiudendo ora si perderà l'ordine non salvato, procedere?"
        },
        "saveChangesContent": {
          "en": "A new order will be created, continue?",
          "it": "Verrà creato un nuovo ordine, procedere?"
        }
      },
      "update": {
        "title": {
          "en": "Order detail",
          "it": "Dettaglio ordine"
        },
        "ctaLabel": {
          "en": "Update Order",
          "it": "Salva Ordine"
        },
        "cancelButton": {
          "en": "Cancel",
          "it": "Cancel"
        },
        "unsavedChangesContent": {
          "en": "Closing now will discard changes to the order, do you want to continue?",
          "it": "Chiudendo ora si perderanno tutte le modifiche non salvate all'ordine, procedere?"
        },
        "saveChangesContent": {
          "en": "The order will be updated, continue?",
          "it": "L'ordine sarà modificato, procedere?"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Not all keys need to be specified, as `customLabels` is merged with default labels. For instance, the following is a valid configuration of `customLabels`:
```json
{
  "tag": "bk-dynamic-form-drawer",
  "properties": {
    ...
    "customLabels": {
      "create": {
        "title": {
          "en": "Add new order",
          "it": "Aggiungi nuovo ordine"
        }
      },
      "update": {
        "title": {
          "en": "Order details",
          "it": "Dettaglio ordine"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### File fields with meta-data

Fields that are of type `object` or `array`, have the format `file`, and include a `dataSchema` or `items` property are displayed within the form.
In this scenario, `dataSchema` and `items` properties are used to determine the shape of the metadata associated with the file.

These fields are rendered with a link plus a button that triggers components [bk-file-picker-modal](#bk-file-picker-modal) or [bk-file-picker-drawer](#bk-file-picker-drawer) to spawn, if included in the plugin configuration. Clicking on these buttons opens up the respective components, enabling interaction with the uploaded files and allowing for the modification of their metadata.

### Working with Views

`bk-dynamic-form-drawer` can be used with data from (Mia-Platform CRUD Service views) [../../runtime_suite/crud-service/writable_views].

#### Lookups

Fields described inside the `dataSchema` as having type `object` or `array` and format `lookup` are rendered as select or multi-select respectively.

Options for such fields will be dynamically fetched from the endpoint specified in `basePath` property, using `/lookup` route provided by the `CRUD service`, which returns a list of objects. Each option fetched like this should have at least a `label` field, which is used as display value inside the form, and a `value` field which is used as unique identifier for such option.

The form stores selected values for lookup fields in their whole (not just `label` and `value` fields). Extra fields are thus available in submit payload, as well as in form [context](#dynamic-context).

Extra queries can be specified to be applied when fetching options using property `lookupQueries`, which maps lookup fields to [queries](../40_core_concepts.md#inline-queries).

```typescript
type LookupQueries: {
  [property: string]: Record<string, unknown> | Record<string, unknown>[]
}
```

For instance, given the following value for `lookupQueries`:
```json
{
  "lookupQueries": {
    "dishes": {
      "calories": {
        "$lt": 300
      }
    }
  }
}
```
options will be fetched form `/lookup/dishes` route with extra condition that "calories" field of dishes collection should be lower than 300.

Dynamic queries are also available, being provided with [form context](#dynamic-context):
```json
{
  "lookupQueries": {
    "dishes": {
      "calories": {
        "$lt": "{{rawObejct maxCalories}}" // rawObject can be used to prevent numeric values from being stringified
      }
    }
  }
}
```
in this case, form field "maxCalories" is used to dynamically compute the query to be used when fetching options.

#### Writable views

`POST` and `PATCH` methods are supported by writable views, and expect the whole object as body of the request. To perform such actions, instead of the default creation or update, it is possible to leverage the `actions` property of the component to include [extra buttons](#extra-buttons).

The following example shows a configuration of `bk-dynamic-form-drawer` designed to interact with writable views:

```json
{
  "tag": "bk-dynamic-form-drawer",
  "properties": {
    "dataSchema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "name": {"type": "string"},
        "rider": {"type": "object", "format": "lookup"} // lookup field, will be rendered as a select field
      }
    },
    "basePath": "/orders-view", // `/orders-view/lookup/rider` will provide a list of options for rider field
    "omitSubmit": true, // omits default submit button, which is designed to follow standard CRUD collections interface
    "actions": {
      "insert": { // performs POST request to `/orders-view/` endpoint with form values as body
        "content": "Add order",
        "type": "primary",
        "action": {
          "type": "http",
          "config": {
            "url": "/orders-view/",
            "method": "POST",
            "body": "{{rawObject values}}"
          }
        }
      },
      "select": { // performs PATCH request to `/orders-view/` endpoint with form values as body
        "content": "Update order",
        "type": "primary",
        "action": {
          "type": "http",
          "config": {
            "url": "/orders-view/",
            "method": "PATCH",
            "body": "{{rawObject context}}"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```


### Conditional Fields

#### Conditionally hide/disable fields

Property `conditionalOptions` allows to specify dynamic conditions for specific extra [form-options](../30_page_layout.md#form-options) to be applied. This allows to dynamically hide, set to readonly, disable fields based on other fields within the form.

Property `conditionalOptions` expects an array of objects with fields:
  - `property`: id of the target field to which extra form-options might be applied
  - `query`: the MongoDB-like [query](../40_core_concepts.md#inline-queries) to be used against current form values in order to establish whether or not to apply the extra form-options to the target field. If the query condition is satisfied by the current form values, form-options are applied. Note that dynamic values can be used to compare values of two entries of the form, via the [context injected](#dynamic-context) by the form.
  - `option`: the form-options value to be dynamically injected to the target field

Updating form fields triggers new evaluation of the conditional options, thus updating the form fields accordingly when necessary.

```typescript
type ConditionalOption: {
  property: string
  query: Record<string, unknown>
  option: RHDOptions
}

type RHDOptions = {
    hidden?: boolean;
    hiddenOnUpdate?: boolean;
    hiddenOnInsert?: boolean;
  } & {
    readOnly?: boolean;
    readOnlyOnUpdate?: boolean;
    readOnlyOnInsert?: boolean;
  } & {
    disabled?: boolean;
    disabledOnUpdate?: boolean;
    disabledOnInsert?: boolean;
  }
```

For instance:
```json
{
  "conditionalOptions": [
    {
      "property": "items",
      "query": {
        "budget": {
          "$lt": "{{rawObject values.totalPrice}}" // dynamic queries can be used to compare values of two entries of the form. In this case, `budget` is compared to `totalPrice`. `rawObject` helper can be used to avoid numeric fields to be stringinfied.
        }
      },
      "option": {
        "disable": true
      }
    },
    {
      "property": "isGift",
      "query": {
        "$or": [
          {"status": {"$eq": "OutOfStock"}},
          {"budget": {"$lt": "{{rawObject context.totalPrice}}"}}
        ]
      },
      "option": {
        "hidden": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Using such configuration, field "items" is disabled once field "budget" is lower than field "totalPrice":

```json
{
  "items": ["fork", "spoon", "napkins"],
  "totalPrice": 15,
  "budget": 7
}
```

Once "budget" field is updated to "20", field "items" is no longer disabled.


#### Conditionally reset fields value

For each field it is possible to specify dynamic validity conditions which depend on other fields of the form using the property `conditionalValues`. Fields that do not meet specified conditions have their value reset.

Property `conditionalValues` expects an array of objects with fields:
  - `property`: id of the target field of which to check the value
  - `query`: the MongoDB-like [query](../40_core_concepts.md#inline-queries) to be used against current form values in order to establish whether or not to reset the value of the target field. As long as the query condition is satisfied by the current form values, the field value is considered valid. Once this is no longer the case, the field value is reset. Note that dynamic values can be used to compare values of two entries of the form, via the [context injected](#dynamic-context) by the form.

Updating form fields triggers new evaluation of the conditional values, thus updating the form fields accordingly when necessary.

:::info
Each entry of an array field is singularly matched against the query. Only invalid entries are removed from the array value.
:::

```typescript
type ConditionalOption: {
  property: string
  query: Record<string, unknown>
}
```

```json
{
  "conditionalValues": [
    {
      "property": "city",
      "query": {
        "city.countryName": {
          "$eq": "country" // `city` is an object field with a `countryName` key. If city.countryName is not equal to the value of `country` form field, `city` field is reset.
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "property": "dishes", // dishes is an array. Each entry of dishes is singularly matched against the query!
      "query": {
        "calories": {
          "$lt": "{{rawObject context.maxCalories}}" // assuming dishes is an array of objects, entries of dishes that have a field `calories` grater than the current value of form field `maxCalories` will be automatically removed from the dishes array. Helper `rawObject` is used to avoid numeric values from being stringified
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

For instance, the following form values are valid according to the above configuration:
```json
{
  "country": "Italy",
  "city": {
    "name": "Milano",
    "countryName": "Italy"
  },
  "dishes": [
    {"name": "Tomato", "calories": 30}, 
    {"name": "Pudding", "calories": 300}, 
  ],
  "maxCalories": 400,
}
```

If the value of field "country" were to be updated to "France", the value of "city" field would be reset, since the first entry of `conditionalValues` would be no longer met:
```json
{
  "country": "France",
  // "city" field is now undefined
  "dishes": [
    {"name": "Tomato", "calories": 30}, 
    {"name": "Pudding", "calories": 300}, 
  ],
  "maxCalories": 400,
}
```

If, furthermore, the value of field "maxCalories" were to be updated to "200", the value of "dishes" field would be updated, resulting in one entry being reset:
```json
{
  "country": "France",
  "dishes": [
    {"name": "Tomato", "calories": 30}
  ],
  "maxCalories": 200,
}
```
Note how each entry of array fields is singularly matched against the query. Only invalid entries are removed from the array value.

### Bootstrap

None




## bk-dynamic-form-modal

Generic modal with a form body and a footer with actions that can be executed on the form values.
By default, allows to edit or create items described by the `dataSchema`, once data is submitted for creation or update.
Custom behavior can be furthermore specified, allowing extra actions to be included in modal footer via buttons.

```html
<bk-dynamic-form-modal></bk-dynamic-form-modal>
```

![form-modal](../img/bk-form-modal.png)

`bk-dynamic-form-modal` is used to display a Modal containing a Form to edit or create items described by the `dataSchema`.

The Modal can be opened in two different modes:

- *insert*, by listening the `add-new` event
- *edit*, by listening the `selected-data` event

### Modes

#### Insert

When the component reacts to the `add-new` event it opens the modal with the initial values specified in the payload of the event. By clicking on the action button of the modal footer, the event `createData` is emitted with payload equal to the object representation of the form values. This event requests the upload of a new item, and is listened by components such as [bk-crud-client](./30_clients.md#bk-crud-client).
If the form contains files, the component emits a `createDataWithFile`, event where payload contains all the data of the form, including files. A component like [bk-file-manager](./30_clients.md#bk-file-manager) should listen to this event and initialize a transaction to create the new item as well as upload the new file to a bucket.
A `transactionId` is added to the meta field of the emitted event to handle possible errors.

#### Edit

When the component reacts to the `selected-data` event it opens the modal with the initial values specified in the payload of the event. By clicking on the action button of the modal footer, the event `updateData` is emitted with payload equal to the object representation of the form values. This event requests the update of an existing item, and is listened by components such as [bk-crud-client](./30_clients.md#bk-crud-client).
If the form contains new files, the component emits a `updateDataWithFile`, event where payload contains all the data of the form, including files. A component like [bk-file-manager](./30_clients.md#bk-file-manager) should listen to this event and initialize a transaction to update the new item as well as upload the new file to a bucket.
A `transactionId` is added to the meta field of the emitted event to handle possible errors.

### Dynamic Context

Several properties of `bk-dynamic-form-modal` allow [dynamic configurations](../40_core_concepts.md#dynamic-configuration). By default, such properties are parsed with [handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/expressions.html) injecting the current state of the form as context through key `values`, as well as other information.

```typescript
{
  values: Record<string, any>
  currentUser: Record<string, any> // information on currently logged user, if available
}
```

### After Submission

When done filling the form, usually `bk-dynamic-form-modal` performs an `update-data` or `create-data` according to the operation invoked to open it (either `add-new` or `select-data`). Usually an http-like client takes care of these operations.
It is often useful to perform other tasks upon creation or editing.
Properties `onSuccess` and `onFail` allow to append an [action](../50_actions.md) to the successful or unsuccessful submission of the form. It is also possible to scope actions based on what [mode](#modes) the modal is operating under.

In the following example, a single action is configured to be executed upon successful data data creation or update, while two different actions are specified for the case of failure.
```json
{
  "onSuccess": {
    "type": "push",
    "config": {
      "url": "/some-url" // on successful form submission, a navigation action to `/some-url` is performed
    }
  },
  "onFail": {
    "insert": {
      "type": "push",
      "config": {
        "url": "/insert-mode-error" // on UNsuccessful data creation, a navigation action to `/insert-mode-error` is performed
      }
    },
    "select": {
      "type": "push",
      "config": {
        "url": "/edit-mode-error" // on successful form submission, a navigation action to `/edit-mode-error` is performed
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Form context can be used in `onSuccess` and `onFail` properties using `handlebars` notation, allowing [dynamic configurations](../40_core_concepts.md#dynamic-configuration). Actions specified with `onSuccess` and `onFail` are parsed with handlebars, injecting the [default context](#dynamic-context), as well as the response of the submission request:

```typescript
{
  currentUser: Record<string, any>
  values: Record<string, any>
  response: Record<string, any>
}
```

where `values` is the form state and `response` contains a JS object which is the content of the `eventBusSuccess` payload linked to the form submission request (either `create-data` or `update-data`).

### Footer Buttons

#### Extra buttons

Other than default submit button, extra buttons can be specified to be included in the modal footer. These can be configured with property `actions`.
By default, property `action` expects an array of objects, each shaped like properties of a [bk-button](./20_buttons.md#bk-button) component, with the additional property `closeAfter`, which controls whether or not the modal should be closed after the action is performed (defaults to true).
However, actions can be scoped depending on the modal opening [mode](#modes).

Property `actions` thus has type:
```typescript
{
  ButtonWithClose[] | {
    insert: ButtonWithClose[]
    select: ButtonWithClose[]
    }
}
```
where
```typescript
type ButtonWithClose = Partial<BkButton> & { closeAfter?: boolean }
```

Actions support [dynamic configurations](../40_core_concepts.md#dynamic-configuration) and are injected with the [default context](#dynamic-context) of the component, which includes the current form values through `values` keyword.

For instance:
```json
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "content": "Cancel"
    },
    {
      "content": "Action GET",
      "action": {
        "type": "http",
        "config": {
          "url": "/some-endpoint",
          "method": "GET"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "closeAfter": false,
      "content": "Action POST",
      "action": {
        "type": "http",
        "config": {
          "url": "/some-endpoint",
          "method": "POST",
          "body": "{{rawObject values}}"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

A `bk-dynamic-form-modal` that were provided with such `actions` property will add three buttons to the footer of the modal, other than the default button for submission:
  - a button with `Cancel` label which simply closes the modal
  - a button with `Action GET` label which performs a GET request to specified endpoint, and closes the modal afterwards
  - a button with `Action POST` label which performs a POST request to specified endpoint with an object representation of current form values as payload, without closing the modal afterwards

#### Omitting submit button

It is possible to omit the default submission button by setting property `omitSubmit` to true.

### Confirmation dialog on save and on close

It is possible to ask for confirmation on close and/or on save, and also customize the dialog texts.

It can be done using the `requireConfirmation` property. It accepts three different values and it is defaulted as `false`:

#### 1. Boolean type

It can be set as `true` to open the dialog on close or as `false` otherwise.

#### 2. Object of type RequireConfirmOpts

An object such as:
```typescript
{
  cancelText?: any; // cancel button text
  okText?: any; // ok button text
  content?: any; // the content text
  title?: any; // the title text
}
```
to customize the dialog texts. They can also be localized, passing an object containing the language acronyms key and the text as value, for example:

```json
{
  "content": {
    "it": "Verrà creato un nuovo elemento, procedere?",
    "en": "A new element will be created, continue?"
  }
}
```

#### 3. Object of type RequireConfirmForm

An object such as:
```typescript
{
  onSave: boolean | RequireConfirmOpts
  onClose: boolean | RequireConfirmOpts
}
```
which is the only way to enable the confirmation dialog on save.

Both `onSave` and `onClose` must be passed in the configuration and both of them accept a `boolean` or a `RequireConfirmOpts` type with the same rules written above in points 1 and 2 of this section. 


### Nested objects

By default, objects and arrays are displayed in `bk-dynamic-form-modal` as JSONs inside an [editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/).
This is not true for objects and arrays of specific [formats](../30_page_layout.md#data-schema) such as `file` or `lookup`, and for objects / arrays for which a data-schema is defined.

In particular, properties `allowObjectAsTable` and `allowNavigation` control how object and array fields with a provided `dataSchema`/`items` key (and no specific `format`) are rendered inside the modal.
- `allowObjectAsTable` controls whether or not the nested fields should be rendered as an editor, a read-only table, or both.
- `allowNavigation` allows to emit a [nested-navigation-state/push](../events#nested-navigation-state---push) event by clicking on the field label. Refer to [this](../page_layout#nested-dataschemas) for further details on nested objects navigation.

By default, setting `allowNavigation` to true disables editor visualization for nested fields. The following table explains how the two properties interact:

| `allowObjectAsTable` | `allowNavigation` | end result |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| true | true | Table visualization only, label can be clicked |
| true | "show-editor" | Table + editor, label can be clicked |
| true | false | Table + editor, label cannot be clicked |
| false | true | No table nor editor, label can be clicked (default configuration) |
| false | "show-editor" | Editor visualization only, label can be clicked |
| false | false | Editor visualization only, label cannot be clicked |

By default, `allowObjectAsTable` is false, `allowNavigation` is true.

:::info
When `allowObjectAsTable` is true, the resulting table supports a subset of the features supported by [bk-table](./60_data_visualization.md#bk-table).
Some of the limitations with respect to `bk-table` include:
  - lookups are not resolved
  - row selection is disabled
  - row click is disabled
:::

### Integrate custom labels

Custom labels can be specified as localized objects, controlling modal title, CTA button label, require confirm message.
Such labels can be scoped based on whether the form is in [edit or create](#modes) mode.

```json
{
  "tag": "bk-dynamic-form-drawer",
  "properties": {
    ...
    "customLabels": {
      "create": {
        "title": {
          "en": "Add new order",
          "it": "Aggiungi nuovo ordine"
        },
        "ctaLabel": {
          "en": "Submit",
          "it": "Submit Order"
        },
        "cancelButton": {
          "en": "Cancel",
          "it": "Cancel"
        },
        "unsavedChangesContent": {
          "en": "Closing now will discard new order, do you want to continue?",
          "it": "Chiudendo ora si perderà l'ordine non salvato, procedere?"
        },
        "saveChangesContent": {
          "en": "A new order will be created, continue?",
          "it": "Verrà creato un nuovo ordine, procedere?"
        }
      },
      "update": {
        "title": {
          "en": "Order detail",
          "it": "Dettaglio ordine"
        },
        "ctaLabel": {
          "en": "Update Order",
          "it": "Salva Ordine"
        },
        "cancelButton": {
          "en": "Cancel",
          "it": "Cancel"
        },
        "unsavedChangesContent": {
          "en": "Closing now will discard changes to the order, do you want to continue?",
          "it": "Chiudendo ora si perderanno tutte le modifiche non salvate all'ordine, procedere?"
        },
        "saveChangesContent": {
          "en": "The order will be updated, continue?",
          "it": "L'ordine sarà modificato, procedere?"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Not all keys need to be specified, as `customLabels` is merged with default labels. For instance, the following is a valid configuration of `customLabels`:
```json
{
  "tag": "bk-dynamic-form-drawer",
  "properties": {
    ...
    "customLabels": {
      "create": {
        "title": {
          "en": "Add new order",
          "it": "Aggiungi nuovo ordine"
        }
      },
      "update": {
        "title": {
          "en": "Order details",
          "it": "Dettaglio ordine"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### File fields with meta-data

Fields that are of type `object` or `array`, have the format `file`, and include a `dataSchema` or `items` property are displayed within the form.
In this scenario, `dataSchema` and `items` properties are used to determine the shape of the metadata associated with the file.

These fields are rendered with a link plus a button that triggers components [bk-file-picker-modal](#bk-file-picker-modal) or [bk-file-picker-drawer](#bk-file-picker-drawer) to spawn, if included in the plugin configuration. Clicking on these buttons opens up the respective components, enabling interaction with the uploaded files and allowing for the modification of their metadata.

### Working with Views

`bk-dynamic-form-modal` can be used with data from (Mia-Platform CRUD Service views) [../../runtime_suite/crud-service/writable_views].

#### Lookups

Fields described inside the `dataSchema` as having type `object` or `array` and format `lookup` are rendered as select or multi-select respectively.

Options for such fields will be dynamically fetched from the endpoint specified in `basePath` property, using `/lookup` route provided by the `CRUD service`, which returns a list of objects. Each option fetched like this should have at least a `label` field, which is used as display value inside the form, and a `value` field which is used as unique identifier for such option.

The form stores selected values for lookup fields in their whole (not just `label` and `value` fields). Extra fields are thus available in submit payload, as well as in form [context](#dynamic-context).

Extra queries can be specified to be applied when fetching options using property `lookupQueries`, which maps lookup fields to [queries](../40_core_concepts.md#inline-queries).

```typescript
type LookupQueries: {
  [property: string]: Record<string, unknown> | Record<string, unknown>[]
}
```

For instance, given the following value for `lookupQueries`:
```json
{
  "lookupQueries": {
    "dishes": {
      "calories": {
        "$lt": 300
      }
    }
  }
}
```
options will be fetched form `/lookup/dishes` route with extra condition that "calories" field of dishes collection should be lower than 300.

Dynamic queries are also available, being provided with [form context](#dynamic-context):
```json
{
  "lookupQueries": {
    "dishes": {
      "calories": {
        "$lt": "{{rawObejct maxCalories}}" // rawObject can be used to prevent numeric values from being stringified
      }
    }
  }
}
```
in this case, form field "maxCalories" is used to dynamically compute the query to be used when fetching options.

#### Writable views

`POST` and `PATCH` methods are supported by writable views, and expect the whole object as body of the request. To perform such actions, instead of the default creation or update, it is possible to leverage the `actions` property of the component to include [extra buttons](#extra-buttons).

The following example shows a configuration of `bk-dynamic-form-modal` designed to interact with writable views:

```json
{
  "tag": "bk-dynamic-form-modal",
  "properties": {
    "dataSchema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "name": {"type": "string"},
        "rider": {"type": "object", "format": "lookup"} // lookup field, will be rendered as a select field
      }
    },
    "basePath": "/orders-view", // `/orders-view/lookup/rider` will provide a list of options for rider field
    "omitSubmit": true, // omits default submit button, which is designed to follow standard CRUD collections interface
    "actions": {
      "insert": { // performs POST request to `/orders-view/` endpoint with form values as body
        "content": "Add order",
        "type": "primary",
        "action": {
          "type": "http",
          "config": {
            "url": "/orders-view/",
            "method": "POST",
            "body": "{{rawObject values}}"
          }
        }
      },
      "select": { // performs PATCH request to `/orders-view/` endpoint with form values as body
        "content": "Update order",
        "type": "primary",
        "action": {
          "type": "http",
          "config": {
            "url": "/orders-view/",
            "method": "PATCH",
            "body": "{{rawObject context}}"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```


### Conditional Fields

#### Conditionally hide/disable fields

Property `conditionalOptions` allows to specify dynamic conditions for specific extra [form-options](../30_page_layout.md#form-options) to be applied. This allows to dynamically hide, set to readonly, disable fields based on other fields within the form.

Property `conditionalOptions` expects an array of objects with fields:
  - `property`: id of the target field to which extra form-options might be applied
  - `query`: the MongoDB-like [query](../40_core_concepts.md#inline-queries) to be used against current form values in order to establish whether or not to apply the extra form-options to the target field. If the query condition is satisfied by the current form values, form-options are applied. Note that dynamic values can be used to compare values of two entries of the form, via the [context injected](#dynamic-context) by the form.
  - `option`: the form-options value to be dynamically injected to the target field

Updating form fields triggers new evaluation of the conditional options, thus updating the form fields accordingly when necessary.

```typescript
type ConditionalOption: {
  property: string
  query: Record<string, unknown>
  option: RHDOptions
}

type RHDOptions = {
    hidden?: boolean;
    hiddenOnUpdate?: boolean;
    hiddenOnInsert?: boolean;
  } & {
    readOnly?: boolean;
    readOnlyOnUpdate?: boolean;
    readOnlyOnInsert?: boolean;
  } & {
    disabled?: boolean;
    disabledOnUpdate?: boolean;
    disabledOnInsert?: boolean;
  }
```

For instance:
```json
{
  "conditionalOptions": [
    {
      "property": "items",
      "query": {
        "budget": {
          "$lt": "{{rawObject values.totalPrice}}" // dynamic queries can be used to compare values of two entries of the form. In this case, `budget` is compared to `totalPrice`. `rawObject` helper can be used to avoid numeric fields to be stringinfied.
        }
      },
      "option": {
        "disable": true
      }
    },
    {
      "property": "isGift",
      "query": {
        "$or": [
          {"status": {"$eq": "OutOfStock"}},
          {"budget": {"$lt": "{{rawObject context.totalPrice}}"}}
        ]
      },
      "option": {
        "hidden": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Using such configuration, field "items" is disabled once field "budget" is lower than field "totalPrice":

```json
{
  "items": ["fork", "spoon", "napkins"],
  "totalPrice": 15,
  "budget": 7
}
```

Once "budget" field is updated to "20", field "items" is no longer disabled.


#### Conditionally reset fields value

For each field it is possible to specify dynamic validity conditions which depend on other fields of the form using the property `conditionalValues`. Fields that do not meet specified conditions have their value reset.

Property `conditionalValues` expects an array of objects with fields:
  - `property`: id of the target field of which to check the value
  - `query`: the MongoDB-like [query](../40_core_concepts.md#inline-queries) to be used against current form values in order to establish whether or not to reset the value of the target field. As long as the query condition is satisfied by the current form values, the field value is considered valid. Once this is no longer the case, the field value is reset. Note that dynamic values can be used to compare values of two entries of the form, via the [context injected](#dynamic-context) by the form.

Updating form fields triggers new evaluation of the conditional values, thus updating the form fields accordingly when necessary.

:::info
Each entry of an array field is singularly matched against the query. Only invalid entries are removed from the array value.
:::

```typescript
type ConditionalOption: {
  property: string
  query: Record<string, unknown>
}
```

```json
{
  "conditionalValues": [
    {
      "property": "city",
      "query": {
        "city.countryName": {
          "$eq": "country" // `city` is an object field with a `countryName` key. If city.countryName is not equal to the value of `country` form field, `city` field is reset.
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "property": "dishes", // dishes is an array. Each entry of dishes is singularly matched against the query!
      "query": {
        "calories": {
          "$lt": "{{rawObject context.maxCalories}}" // assuming dishes is an array of objects, entries of dishes that have a field `calories` grater than the current value of form field `maxCalories` will be automatically removed from the dishes array. Helper `rawObject` is used to avoid numeric values from being stringified
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

For instance, the following form values are valid according to the above configuration:
```json
{
  "country": "Italy",
  "city": {
    "name": "Milano",
    "countryName": "Italy"
  },
  "dishes": [
    {"name": "Tomato", "calories": 30}, 
    {"name": "Pudding", "calories": 300}, 
  ],
  "maxCalories": 400,
}
```

If the value of field "country" were to be updated to "France", the value of "city" field would be reset, since the first entry of `conditionalValues` would be no longer met:
```json
{
  "country": "France",
  // "city" field is now undefined
  "dishes": [
    {"name": "Tomato", "calories": 30}, 
    {"name": "Pudding", "calories": 300}, 
  ],
  "maxCalories": 400,
}
```

If, furthermore, the value of field "maxCalories" were to be updated to "200", the value of "dishes" field would be updated, resulting in one entry being reset:
```json
{
  "country": "France",
  "dishes": [
    {"name": "Tomato", "calories": 30}
  ],
  "maxCalories": 200,
}
```
Note how each entry of array fields is singularly matched against the query. Only invalid entries are removed from the array value.

## bk-file-picker-drawer

drawer containing a drag-and-drop area to handle file uploads/downloads.

```html
<bk-file-picker-drawer></bk-file-picker-drawer>
```

`bk-file-picker-drawer` listens for the [link-file-to-record](../70_events.md#link-file-to-record) event, which enables the editing of a file object/array within the payload using the specified property name in the event's meta.

When a new file is uploaded, the [standard file management](../40_core_concepts.md#file-management) is initiated through an [upload-file](../70_events.md#upload-file) event.

Files are expected to respect [Mia Files Service](../../../runtime_suite/files-service/configuration) interface, that is:
```json
{
  "_id": {
    "type": "string"
  },
  "name": {
    "type": "string"
  },
  "file": {
    "type": "string"
  },
  "size": {
    "type": "number"
  },
  "location": {
    "type": "string"
  }
}
```

For instance, a `link-file-to-record` event with the following payload and meta: 

```json
{
  "payload": {
    "name": "Joe",
    "surename": "Smith",
    "image": {
      "_id": "file-id",
      "name": "fileName.jpg",
      "file": "file.jpg",
      "size": 3992,
      "location": "/v2/files/download/file.jpg"
    },
    ...
  },
  "meta": {
    "property": "image"
  }
}
```

will spawn the `bk-file-picker-drawer` component which will allow to interact with the file in the "image" field.


### Array of files

To utilize `bk-file-picker-drawer` with an array of files, it is necessary to include the `dataSchema` property in the configuration. Otherwise, the component will only handle one file at a time.

```json
...
{
  "tag": "bk-file-picker-drawer",
  "properties": {
    "dataSchema": {
      "documents": {
        "type": "array",
        "format": "file"
      },
      ...
    }
  }
},
...
```

### Metadata

File fields may themselves have a `dataSchema` or `items` property.

In the case of an edited file field having such properties, the `bk-file-picker-drawer` not only includes the drag-and-drop area but also provides an area to edit the metadata associated with the file field: for file fields of type object, a form is displayed, while for file fields of type array, an accordion of forms is presented.

Only fields of type string are supported for metadata.

```json
{
  "image": {
    "type": "object",
    "format": "file",
    "dataSchema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "ownerId": {
          "type": "string"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
```json
{
  "images": {
    "type": "array",
    "format": "file",
    "items": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "ownerId": {
          "type": "string"
        }
      }
    }
  }

### Reusing Uploaded Files

To enable the reusability of already uploaded files, follow these steps:
  
  - Set the `previewUploadedFiles` property to true in the configuration of the `bk-file-picker-modal` component.
    Note: This feature requires [Mia Files Service](../../../runtime_suite/files-service/configuration) version 2.7.0 or higher.
  
  - When the modal is opened, the files from the bucket will be loaded.
    These files will be displayed to the user as a preview inside the modal and can be selected using checkboxes.
  
  - If [metadata](#metadata-1) is available for the files, it can be accessed through a drawer within the modal.
    The metadata will be presented based on the `data-schema` specified for the corresponding file field being updated. Keep in mind that some data may not be visible depending on the data-schema.

## bk-form-drawer

:::caution
This component is deprecated. Use [bk-dynamic-form-drawer](#bk-dyanamic-form-drawer) instead.
:::

Drawer containing a Form to edit or create items described by the `dataSchema`, once data is submitted for creation or update, drawer is put in loading state. The component is composed of a generic Drawer component, a generic Form component, thus it listens to and emits all the events that these do.

```html
<bk-form-drawer></bk-form-drawer>
```

![form-drawer](../img/bk-form-drawer.png)


`bk-form-drawer` is used to display a Drawer containing a Form to edit or create items described by the `dataSchema`.

The Drawer can be opened in two different modes:

- *insert*, by listening the `add-new` event
- *edit*, by listening the `selected-data` event

### Drawer modes

#### Insert

Example of configuration for form-drawer component in insert/edit mode:

```json
{
  "tag": "bk-form-drawer",
  "properties": {
    "dataSchema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        ...
      }
    },
    ...
}
```

When the component reacts to the `add-new` event it opens the drawer with the initial values specified in the payload of the event. By clicking on the action button of the Form you can submit the content to perform an upload of a new item. If the form contains files, the component emits a `createDataWithFile` event where payload contains all the data of the form, including files. If no file is specified, a `createData` event is used. In both cases, a `transactionId` is used inside the meta field of the event to handle possible errors.

:::info
If the `description` field is specified in a dataschema property, a info icon is shown next to the form field label and a tooltip with the description appears when the mouse is over the icon.
:::

#### Edit

The `selected-data` event opens the drawer in edit mode with possible initial values specified in the payload of the event. In this case, the action button of the Form perform an update of an existing field. If the form contains files, the component emits a `updateDataWithFile` event where payload contains all the data of the form. If no file is specified, a `updateData` event is used. In both cases, a `transactionId` is used inside the meta field of the event to handle possible errors.  

### After submission

When done filling up this drawer form, usually `bk-form-drawer` performs an `update-data` or `create-data` according to the operation invoked to open it (either `add-new` or `select-data`). Usually an http-like client takes care of these operations.
It is often useful to perform other tasks upon successful creation or editing. The prop `afterFinishEvents` allows to append events or `pushState` navigation instructions. To configure this feature we can provide to `afterFinishEvents`

1. a string, which will pipe an event in the `EventBus` using its value as label
2. an array of strings, launching multiple events in the given order
3. an event,

```typescript
{
  label: string
  payload: Record<string, any>
  meta?: Record<string, any>
}
```

4. an array of events, which are sent to the `EventBus`.
5. a **single** `pushState` context, which is a generic object data and an optional URL to perform navigation

```typescript
{
  data: any
  url?: string
}
```

:::caution
if `data` is an object and current `window.history.state` is an object, they are merged with priority to `data`'s keys
:::

Form context can be used into the events/pushState sent after submission using `handlebars` notation. Each event payload and both `pushState` arguments are parsed with handlebars
injecting the following context

```typescript
{
  values: Record<string, any>
  response: Record<string, any>
}
```

where `values` is the form state and response contains a JS object which is the content of the `eventBusSuccess` payload linked to the form submission request (either `create-data` or `update-data`)

### Confirmation dialog on save and on close

It is possible to ask for confirmation on close and/or on save, and also customize the dialog texts.

It can be done using the `requireConfirmation` prop. It accepts three different values and it is defaulted as `false`:

#### 1. Boolean type

It can be set as `true` to open the dialog on close or as `false` otherwise.

#### 2. Object of type RequireConfirmOpts

An object such as:
```typescript
{
  cancelText?: any; // cancel button text
  okText?: any; // ok button text
  content?: any; // the content text
  title?: any; // the title text
}
```
to customize the dialog texts. They can also be localized, passing an object containing the language acronyms key and the text as value, for example:

```json
{
  "content": {
    "it": "Verrà creato un nuovo elemento, procedere?",
    "en": "A new element will be created, continue?"
  }
}
```

#### 3. Object of type RequireConfirmForm

An object such as:
```typescript
{
  onSave: boolean | RequireConfirmOpts
  onClose: boolean | RequireConfirmOpts
}
```
which is the only way to enable the confirmation dialog on save.

Both `onSave` and `onClose` must be passed in the configuration and both of them accept a `boolean` or a `RequireConfirmOpts` type with the same rules written above in points 1 and 2 of this section. 


### Custom labels

Custom labels can be specified as [LocalizedText](../40_core_concepts.md#localization-and-i18n) as modal title, CTA button label, require confirm message.
Such labels can be scoped based on whether the form is in [edit](#edit-1) or [create](#insert-1) mode.

          "it": "Salva Ordine"
        },
        "unsavedChangesContent": {
          "it": "Chiudendo ora si perderanno tutte le modifiche non salvate all'ordine, procedere?",
          "en": "Closing now will discard changes to the order, do you want to continue?"
        },
        "saveChangesContent": {
          "it": "Verrà creato un nuovo ordine, procedere?",
          "en": "A new order will be created, continue?"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Not all keys need to be specified, as `customLabels` is merged with default labels. For instance, the following is a valid configuration of `customLabels`:
```json
{
  "tag": "bk-form-drawer",
  "properties": {
    ...
    "customLabels": {
      "create": {
        "title": {
          "en": "Add new order",
          "it": "Aggiungi nuovo ordine"
        }
      },
      "update": {
        "title": {
          "en": "Order detail",
          "it": "Dettaglio ordine"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### File fields with meta-data

Fields that are of type `object` or `array`, have the format `file`, and include a `dataSchema` or `items` property are displayed within the form.
In this scenario, `dataSchema` and `items` properties are used to determine the shape of the metadata associated with the file.

These fields are rendered with a link plus a button that triggers components [bk-file-picker-modal](#bk-file-picker-modal) or [bk-file-picker-drawer](#bk-file-picker-drawer) to spawn, if included in the plugin configuration. Clicking on these buttons opens up the respective components, enabling interaction with the uploaded files and allowing for the modification of their metadata.

## bk-form-modal

:::caution
This component is deprecated. Use [bk-dynamic-form-modal](#bk-dyanamic-form-modal) instead, or [bk-form-wizard](#bk-form-wizard) if you are using `bk-form-modal` as [wizard](#wizard).
:::

Modal containing a Form to edit or create items described by the `dataSchema`, once data is submitted for creation or update, modal is put in loading state. The component is composed of a generic Modal component, a generic Form component, thus it listens to and emits all the events that these do.

```html
<bk-form-modal></bk-form-modal>
```

![form-modal](../img/bk-form-modal.png)

`bk-form-modal` is used to display a Modal containing a Form to edit or create items described by the `dataSchema`.

The Modal can be opened in three different modes:

- *insert*, by listening the `add-new` event
- *edit*, by listening the `selected-data` event
- *external*, by listening the `add-new-external` event

### Modal modes

#### Insert

Example of configuration for form-modal component in insert/edit mode:

```json
{
  "tag": "bk-form-modal",
  "properties": {
    "dataSchema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        ...
      }
    },
    ...
}
```

When the component reacts to the `add-new` event it opens the modal with the initial values specified in the payload of the event. By clicking on the action button of the Form you can submit the content to perform an upload of a new item. If the form contains files, the component emits a `createDataWithFile` event where payload contains all the data of the form, including files. If no file is specified, a `createData` event is used. In both cases, a `transactionId` is used inside the meta field of the event to handle possible errors.

:::info
If the `description` field is specified in a dataschema property, a info icon is shown next to the form field label and a tooltip with the description appears when the mouse is over the icon.
:::

#### Edit

The `selected-data` event opens the modal in edit mode with possible initial values specified in the payload of the event. In this case, the action button of the Form perform an update of an existing field. If the form contains files, the component emits a `updateDataWithFile` event where payload contains all the data of the form. If no file is specified, a `updateData` event is used. In both cases, a `transactionId` is used inside the meta field of the event to handle possible errors.  

#### External

Example of configuration for form-modal component in external mode:

```json
{
  "tag": "bk-form-modal",
  "properties": {
    "dataSchema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        ...
      }
    },
    "extraEndpoint": "/extra-data-post",
    ...
}
```

The `add-new-external` event opens the modal in external mode with possible initial values specified in the payload of the event. In this case, the action button of the Form perform a HTTP POST to the endpoint specified in the `extraEndpoint` property. If the form contains files, the component  performs a HTTP POST using as body a multipart object that contains all the data of the form, including files. If no file is specified, the HTTP POST uses as body a JSON object.

If the HTTP request is completed successfully, the component emits a `success` event, instead, in case of errors, it emits a `error` event. Either way, a `triggeredBy` field is injected into the meta of the event with value `bk-form-modal-extra-endpoint`. Components such as [bk-notifications](./70_misc.md#triggering-notifications) leverage `triggeredBy` for displaying push notifications.

### After submission

When done filling up this modal form, usually `bk-form-modal` performs an `update-data` or `create-data` according to the operation invoked to open it (either `add-new` or `select-data`). Usually an http-like client takes care of these operations.
It is often useful to perform other tasks upon successful creation or editing. The prop `afterFinishEvents` allows to append events or `pushState` navigation instructions. To configure this feature we can provide to `afterFinishEvents`

1. a string, which will pipe an event in the `EventBus` using its value as label
2. an array of strings, launching multiple events in the given order
3. an event,

```typescript
{
  label: string
  payload: Record<string, any>
  meta?: Record<string, any>
}
```

4. an array of events, which are sent to the `EventBus`.
5. a **single** `pushState` context, which is a generic object data and an optional URL to perform navigation

```typescript
{
  data: any
  url?: string
}
```

:::caution
if `data` is an object and current `window.history.state` is an object, they are merged with priority to `data`'s keys
:::

Form context can be used into the events/pushState sent after submission using `handlebars` notation. Each event payload and both `pushState` arguments are parsed with handlebars
injecting the following context

```typescript
{
  values: Record<string, any>
  response: Record<string, any>
}
```

where `values` is the form state and response contains a JS object which is the content of the `eventBusSuccess` payload linked to the form submission request (either `create-data` or `update-data`)

### Wizard

![wizard-form-modal](../img/wizard-form-modal.png)

It is possible to split data insertion into multiple steps via the `wizard` property.

:::info
Wizard representation is currently only availabe when inserting new data, not in case of update.
:::

`wizard` allows values like the following:

- `true`
- `false`
- an array of objects like:

```typescript
{
  keys: string[],
  labels: {
    wizardNext?: LocalizedText
    wizardPrevious?: LocalizedText
    wizardAddNew?: LocalizedText
    wizardSubmit?: LocalizedText
    stepperTitle?: LocalizedText
    stepperSubtitle?: LocalizedText
    accordionHeader?: LocalizedText
    accordionEmptyComponent?: LocalizedText
  }
  asForm?: boolean
}
```

Each such element maps to a step of the wizard as follows:

| property | description |
|----------|-------------|
| `keys` | fields to display in the step |
| `labels` | localized labels with the text to show |
| `asForm` | whether to visualize a single nested object as a form / nested array accordion of forms. Ignored if the step includes more than one field |

If a step meets the following requirements:

- only includes one field
- the field is of type `object` or `array` and has a property `dataSchema`
- `asForm` is set to true

Then the field will be displayed as a form in case of an `object` field, or as an accordion of forms in case of an `array` field.

![wizard-form-modal-accordion](../img/wizard-form-modal-accordion.png)

`labels` are mapped to displayed text as follows:

| key | description |
|----------|-------------|
| `wizardNext` | Button for going to next step |
| `wizardPrevious` | Button for going back to previous step |
| `wizardAddNew` | Button for adding a new element to an array, when displayed as an accordion |
| `wizardSubmit` | Button for submitting the form in the final step |
| `stepperTitle` | Title of the stepper component |
| `stepperSubtitle` | Subtitle of the stepper component |
| `accordionHeader` | Title of the accordion panel. An incremental is automatically added as panels are added to the accordion |
| `accordionEmptyComponent` | Text to display when the accordion is empty |

By default, `wizard` is false.

When set to `true`:

- the fields are automatically split so that:
  - the first group contains all fields that are not nested objects or nested arrays
  - each of the following steps contains one of the remaining fields, with `asForm` set to true
- default labels are applied.

### Confirmation dialog on save and on close

It is possible to ask for confirmation on close and/or on save, and also customize the dialog texts.

It can be done using the `requireConfirmation` prop. It accepts three different values and it is defaulted as `false`:

#### 1. Boolean type

It can be set as `true` to open the dialog on close or as `false` otherwise.

#### 2. Object of type RequireConfirmOpts

An object such as:
```typescript
{
  cancelText?: any; // cancel button text
  okText?: any; // ok button text
  content?: any; // the content text
  title?: any; // the title text
}
```
to customize the dialog texts. They can also be localized, passing an object containing the language acronyms key and the text as value, for example:

```json
{
  "content": {
    "it": "Verrà creato un nuovo elemento, procedere?",
    "en": "A new element will be created, continue?"
  }
}
```

#### 3. Object of type RequireConfirmForm

An object such as:
```typescript
{
  onSave: boolean | RequireConfirmOpts
  onClose: boolean | RequireConfirmOpts
}
```
which is the only way to enable the confirmation dialog on save.

Both `onSave` and `onClose` must be passed in the configuration and both of them accept a `boolean` or a `RequireConfirmOpts` type with the same rules written above in points 1 and 2 of this section. 


### Nested objects

By default, objects and arrays are displayed in `bk-form-modal` as JSONs inside an [editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/).
This is not true for objects and arrays of specific [formats](../30_page_layout.md#data-schema) such as `file` or `multilookup`, and for objects / arrays for which a data-schema is defined.

In particular, properties `allowObjectAsTable` and `allowNavigation` control how object and array fields with a provided data-schema (and no specific `format`) are rendered inside the modal.
- `allowObjectAsTable` controls whether or not the nested fields should be rendered as an editor, a read-only table, or both.
- `allowNavigation` allows to emit a [nested-navigation-state/push](../events#nested-navigation-state---push) event by clicking on the field label. Refer to [this](../page_layout#nested-dataschemas) for further details on nested objects navigation.

By default, setting `allowNavigation` to true disables editor visualization for nested fields. The following table explains how the two properties interact:

| `allowObjectAsTable` | `allowNavigation` | end result |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| true | true | Table visualization only, label can be clicked |
| true | "show-editor" | Table + editor, label can be clicked |
| true | false | Table + editor, label cannot be clicked |
| false | true | No table nor editor, label can be clicked (default configuration) |
| false | "show-editor" | Editor visualization only, label can be clicked |
| false | false | Editor visualization only, label cannot be clicked |

By default, `allowObjectAsTable` is false, `allowNavigation` is true.

:::info
When `allowObjectAsTable` is true, the resulting table supports a subset of the features supported by [bk-table](./60_data_visualization.md#bk-table).
Some of the limitations with respect to `bk-table` include:
  - lookups are not resolved
  - row selection is disabled
  - row click is disabled
:::

### Custom labels

Custom labels can be specified as [LocalizedText](../40_core_concepts.md#localization-and-i18n) as modal title, CTA button label, require confirm message.
Such labels can be scoped based on whether the form is in [edit](#edit-1) or [create](#insert-1) mode.



```json
{
  "tag": "bk-form-modal",
  "properties": {
    ...
    "customLabels": {
      "create": {
        "title": {
          "en": "Add new order",
          "it": "Aggiungi nuovo ordine"
        },
        "ctaLabel": {
          "en": "Submit",
          "it": "Submit Order"
        },
        "unsavedChangesContent": {
          "it": "Chiudendo ora si perderà l'ordine non salvate, procedere?",
          "en": "Closing now will discard new order, do you want to continue?"
        },
        "saveChangesContent": {
          "it": "Verrà creato un nuovo ordine, procedere?",
          "en": "A new order will be created, continue?"
        }
      },
      "update": {
        "title": {
          "en": "Order detail",
          "it": "Dettaglio ordine"
        },
        "ctaLabel": {
          "en": "Update Order",
          "it": "Salva Ordine"
        },
        "unsavedChangesContent": {
          "it": "Chiudendo ora si perderanno tutte le modifiche non salvate all'ordine, procedere?",
          "en": "Closing now will discard changes to the order, do you want to continue?"
        },
        "saveChangesContent": {
          "it": "Verrà creato un nuovo ordine, procedere?",
          "en": "A new order will be created, continue?"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Not all keys need to be specified, as `customLabels` is merged with default labels. For instance, the following is a valid configuration of `customLabels`:
```json
{
  "tag": "bk-form-modal",
  "properties": {
    ...
    "customLabels": {
      "create": {
        "title": {
          "en": "Add new order",
          "it": "Aggiungi nuovo ordine"
        }
      },
      "update": {
        "title": {
          "en": "Order detail",
          "it": "Dettaglio ordine"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### File fields with meta-data

Fields that are of type `object` or `array`, have the format `file`, and include a `dataSchema` or `items` property are displayed within the form.
In this scenario, `dataSchema` and `items` properties are used to determine the shape of the metadata associated with the file.

These fields are rendered with a link plus a button that triggers components [bk-file-picker-modal](#bk-file-picker-modal) or [bk-file-picker-drawer](#bk-file-picker-drawer) to spawn, if included in the plugin configuration. Clicking on these buttons opens up the respective components, enabling interaction with the uploaded files and allowing for the modification of their metadata.

## bk-form-wizard

`bk-form-wizard` is an extension of [bk-dynamic-form-modal](#bk-dynamic-form-modal) that allows to split data insertion / editing into multiple steps. Each step consists of a form or an accordion of forms and allows to fill-in / edit a subset of the data properties. Navigation among steps is possible through buttons displayed inside the footer of the modal. Upon reaching the last step, it is possible to submit the wizard. This causes emission of an event `create-data` or `update-data`, with a payload obtained by aggregating form values of each step. 

```html
<bk-form-wizard></bk-form-wizard>
```

![wizard-form-modal](../img/wizard-form-modal.png)

By default, the component analyzes its `dataSchema` property to automatically configure each step.
All fields that are not nested objects or nested arrays are displayed as a form in the first step of the modal. Each of the following steps is composed of a single nested object or array field, the fields of which are editable through a form.

### Customize wizard steps

Property `wizard` allows to configure each step specifying an array of objects with three properties, `keys`, `labels`, `asForm`.

```typescript
type WizardStepSchema = {
  keys: string[],
  labels: {
    wizardNext?: LocalizedText
    wizardPrevious?: LocalizedText
    wizardAddNew?: LocalizedText
    stepperTitle?: LocalizedText
    stepperSubtitle?: LocalizedText
    accordionHeader?: LocalizedText
    accordionEmptyComponent?: LocalizedText
  }
  asForm?: boolean
}
```

Each such element maps to a step of the wizard as follows:

| property | description |
|----------|-------------|
| `keys` | fields to display in the step |
| `labels` | [localized labels](../40_core_concepts.md#localization-and-i18n) with the text to show |
| `asForm` | whether to visualize a single nested object as a form or a single nested array as an accordion of forms. Ignored if the step includes more than one field. Defaults to true. |

If a step meets the following requirements:
  - only includes one field
  - the field is of type `object` or `array` and has a property `dataSchema`
  - `asForm` is set to true (default)

Then the field will be displayed as a form in case of an `object` field, or as an accordion of forms in case of an `array` field.

![wizard-form-modal-accordion](../img/wizard-form-modal-accordion.png)

`labels` are mapped to displayed text as follows:

| key | description |
|----------|-------------|
| `wizardNext` | Button for going to next step |
| `wizardPrevious` | Button for going back to previous step |
| `wizardAddNew` | Button for adding a new element to an array, when displayed as an accordion |
| `wizardSubmit` | Button for submitting the form in the final step |
| `stepperTitle` | Title of the stepper component |
| `stepperSubtitle` | Subtitle of the stepper component |
| `accordionHeader` | Title of the accordion panel. An incremental is automatically added as panels are added to the accordion |
| `accordionEmptyComponent` | Text to display when the accordion is empty |

### Dynamic Context

Several properties of `bk-form-wizard` allow [dynamic configurations](../40_core_concepts.md#dynamic-configuration). By default, such properties are parsed with [handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/expressions.html) injecting the values of the current step through `step` key, and aggregated data from each step through key `values`, as well as other information.

```typescript
{
  values: Record<string, any>
  step: Record<string, any>
  currentUser: Record<string, any> // information on currently logged user, if available
}
```

### After Submission

When done filling each step, usually `bk-form-wizard` performs an `update-data` or `create-data` according to the operation invoked to open it (either `add-new` or `select-data`). Usually an http-like client takes care of these operations.
It is often useful to perform other tasks upon creation or editing.
Properties `onSuccess` and `onFail` allow to append an [action](../50_actions.md) to the successful or unsuccessful submission of the data. It is also possible to scope actions based on what [mode](#modes) the wizard is operating under.

In the following example, a single action is configured to be executed upon successful data data creation or update, while two different actions are specified for the case of failure.

```json
{
  "onSuccess": {
    "type": "push",
    "config": {
      "url": "/some-url" // on successful form submission, a navigation action to `/some-url` is performed
    }
  },
  "onFail": {
    "insert": {
      "type": "push",
      "config": {
        "url": "/insert-mode-error" // on UNsuccessful data creation, a navigation action to `/insert-mode-error` is performed
      }
    },
    "select": {
      "type": "push",
      "config": {
        "url": "/edit-mode-error" // on successful form submission, a navigation action to `/edit-mode-error` is performed
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Form context can be used in `onSuccess` and `onFail` properties using `handlebars` notation, allowing [dynamic configurations](../40_core_concepts.md#dynamic-configuration). Actions specified with `onSuccess` and `onFail` are parsed with handlebars, injecting the [default context](#dynamic-context), as well as the response of the submission request:

```typescript
{
  currentUser: Record<string, any>
  values: Record<string, any>
  step: Record<string, any>
  response: Record<string, any>
}
```

where `step` is the state of the form of the current step, `values` is the aggregated values of all steps, `response` contains a JS object which is the content of the `eventBusSuccess` payload linked to the form submission request (either `create-data` or `update-data`).

### Footer Buttons

By default, the footer of the modal includes two buttons, which allow to navigate to the previous and next step. Upon reaching the last step, a submission button is spawned. If the current step includes an accordion of forms to edit a nested array, a button to add a new entry is also available.

#### Extra buttons

Other than default ones, extra buttons can be specified to be included in the modal footer. These can be configured with property `actions`.
By default, property `action` expects an array of objects, each shaped like properties of a [bk-button](./20_buttons.md#bk-button) component, with the additional property `closeAfter`, which controls whether or not the wizard should be closed after the action is performed (defaults to true).
However, actions can be scoped depending on the opening [mode](#modes).

Property `actions` thus has type:
```typescript
{
  ButtonWithClose[] | {
    insert: ButtonWithClose[]
    select: ButtonWithClose[]
  }
}
```
where
```typescript
type ButtonWithClose = Partial<BkButton> & { closeAfter?: boolean }
```

Actions support [dynamic configurations](../40_core_concepts.md#dynamic-configuration) and are injected with the [default context](#dynamic-context) of the component, which includes the current form values through `values` keyword.

For instance:
```json
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "content": "Cancel"
    },
    {
      "content": "Action GET",
      "action": {
        "type": "http",
        "config": {
          "url": "/some-endpoint",
          "method": "GET"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "closeAfter": false,
      "content": "Action POST",
      "action": {
        "type": "http",
        "config": {
          "url": "/some-endpoint",
          "method": "POST",
          "body": "{{rawObject values}}"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

A `bk-form-wizard` that were provided with such `actions` property will add three buttons to the footer of the modal, other than the default button for submission:
  - a button with `Cancel` label which simply closes the modal
  - a button with `Action GET` label which performs a GET request to specified endpoint, and closes the modal afterwards
  - a button with `Action POST` label which performs a POST request to specified endpoint with an object representation of current form values as payload, without closing the modal afterwards

#### Omitting submit button

It is possible to omit the default submission button by setting property `omitSubmit` to true.

### Confirmation dialog on save and on close

It is possible to ask for confirmation on close and/or on save, and also customize the dialog texts.

It can be done using the `requireConfirmation` property. It accepts three different values and it is defaulted as `false`:

#### 1. Boolean type

It can be set as `true` to open the dialog on close or as `false` otherwise.

#### 2. Object of type RequireConfirmOpts

An object such as:
```typescript
{
  cancelText?: any; // cancel button text
  okText?: any; // ok button text
  content?: any; // the content text
  title?: any; // the title text
}
```
to customize the dialog texts. They can also be localized, passing an object containing the language acronyms key and the text as value, for example:

```json
{
  "content": {
    "it": "Verrà creato un nuovo elemento, procedere?",
    "en": "A new element will be created, continue?"
  }
}
```

#### 3. Object of type RequireConfirmForm

An object such as:
```typescript
{
  onSave: boolean | RequireConfirmOpts
  onClose: boolean | RequireConfirmOpts
}
```
which is the only way to enable the confirmation dialog on save.

Both `onSave` and `onClose` must be passed in the configuration and both of them accept a `boolean` or a `RequireConfirmOpts` type with the same rules written above in points 1 and 2 of this section. 

### Integrate custom labels

Custom labels can be specified as localized objects, controlling modal title, CTA button label, require confirm message.
Such labels can be scoped based on whether the form is in [edit or create](#modes) mode.

It is also possible to specify [wizard specific](#customize-wizard-steps) labels with `customLabels` property, which will however be overwritten by the labels specified in `wizard` property.

```json
{
  "tag": "bk-dynamic-form-drawer",
  "properties": {
    ...
    "customLabels": {
      "create": {
        "title": {
          "en": "Add new order",
          "it": "Aggiungi nuovo ordine"
        },
        "ctaLabel": {
          "en": "Submit",
          "it": "Submit Order"
        },
        "cancelButton": {
          "en": "Cancel",
          "it": "Cancel"
        },
        "unsavedChangesContent": {
          "en": "Closing now will discard new order, do you want to continue?",
          "it": "Chiudendo ora si perderà l'ordine non salvato, procedere?"
        },
        "saveChangesContent": {
          "en": "A new order will be created, continue?",
          "it": "Verrà creato un nuovo ordine, procedere?"
        }
      },
      "update": {
        "title": {
          "en": "Order detail",
          "it": "Dettaglio ordine"
        },
        "ctaLabel": {
          "en": "Update Order",
          "it": "Salva Ordine"
        },
        "cancelButton": {
          "en": "Cancel",
          "it": "Cancel"
        },
        "unsavedChangesContent": {
          "en": "Closing now will discard changes to the order, do you want to continue?",
          "it": "Chiudendo ora si perderanno tutte le modifiche non salvate all'ordine, procedere?"
        },
        "saveChangesContent": {
          "en": "The order will be updated, continue?",
          "it": "L'ordine sarà modificato, procedere?"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Not all keys need to be specified, as `customLabels` is merged with default labels. For instance, the following is a valid configuration of `customLabels`:
```json
{
  "tag": "bk-dynamic-form-drawer",
  "properties": {
    ...
    "customLabels": {
      "create": {
        "title": {
          "en": "Add new order",
          "it": "Aggiungi nuovo ordine"
        }
      },
      "update": {
        "title": {
          "en": "Order details",
          "it": "Dettaglio ordine"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### File fields with meta-data

Fields that are of type `object` or `array`, have the format `file`, and include a `dataSchema` or `items` property are displayed within the form.
In this scenario, `dataSchema` and `items` properties are used to determine the shape of the metadata associated with the file.

These fields are rendered with a link plus a button that triggers components [bk-file-picker-modal](#bk-file-picker-modal) or [bk-file-picker-drawer](#bk-file-picker-drawer) to spawn, if included in the plugin configuration. Clicking on these buttons opens up the respective components, enabling interaction with the uploaded files and allowing for the modification of their metadata.

### Working with Views

`bk-form-wizard` can be used with data from (Mia-Platform CRUD Service views) [../../runtime_suite/crud-service/writable_views].

#### Lookups

Fields described inside the `dataSchema` as having type `object` or `array` and format `lookup` are rendered as select or multi-select respectively.

Options for such fields will be dynamically fetched from the endpoint specified in `basePath` property, using `/lookup` route provided by the `CRUD service`, which returns a list of objects. Each option fetched like this should have at least a `label` field, which is used as display value inside the form, and a `value` field which is used as unique identifier for such option.

The form stores selected values for lookup fields in their whole (not just `label` and `value` fields). Extra fields are thus available in submit payload, as well as in form [context](#dynamic-context).

Extra queries can be specified to be applied when fetching options using property `lookupQueries`, which maps lookup fields to [queries](../40_core_concepts.md#inline-queries).

```typescript
type LookupQueries: {
  [property: string]: Record<string, unknown> | Record<string, unknown>[]
}
```

For instance, given the following value for `lookupQueries`:
```json
{
  "lookupQueries": {
    "dishes": {
      "calories": {
        "$lt": 300
      }
    }
  }
}
```
options will be fetched form `/lookup/dishes` route with extra condition that "calories" field of dishes collection should be lower than 300.

Dynamic queries are also available, being provided with [form context](#dynamic-context):
```json
{
  "lookupQueries": {
    "dishes": {
      "calories": {
        "$lt": "{{rawObejct maxCalories}}" // rawObject can be used to prevent numeric values from being stringified
      }
    }
  }
}
```
in this case, form field "maxCalories" is used to dynamically compute the query to be used when fetching options.

#### Writable views

`POST` and `PATCH` methods are supported by writable views, and expect the whole object as body of the request. To perform such actions, instead of the default creation or update, it is possible to leverage the `actions` property of the component to include [extra buttons](#extra-buttons).

The following example shows a configuration of `bk-form-wizard` designed to interact with writable views:

```json
{
  "tag": "bk-form-wizard",
  "properties": {
    "dataSchema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "name": {"type": "string"},
        "rider": {"type": "object", "format": "lookup"} // lookup field, will be rendered as a select field
      }
    },
    "basePath": "/orders-view", // `/orders-view/lookup/rider` will provide a list of options for rider field
    "omitSubmit": true, // omits default submit button, which is designed to follow standard CRUD collections interface
    "actions": {
      "insert": { // performs POST request to `/orders-view/` endpoint with form values as body
        "content": "Add order",
        "type": "primary",
        "action": {
          "type": "http",
          "config": {
            "url": "/orders-view/",
            "method": "POST",
            "body": "{{rawObject values}}"
          }
        }
      },
      "select": { // performs PATCH request to `/orders-view/` endpoint with form values as body
        "content": "Update order",
        "type": "primary",
        "action": {
          "type": "http",
          "config": {
            "url": "/orders-view/",
            "method": "PATCH",
            "body": "{{rawObject context}}"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```


### Conditional Fields

#### Conditionally hide/disable fields

Property `conditionalOptions` allows to specify dynamic conditions for specific extra [form-options](../30_page_layout.md#form-options) to be applied. This allows to dynamically hide, set to readonly, disable fields based on other fields within the form.

Property `conditionalOptions` expects an array of objects with fields:
  - `property`: id of the target field to which extra form-options might be applied
  - `query`: the MongoDB-like [query](../40_core_concepts.md#inline-queries) to be used against current form values in order to establish whether or not to apply the extra form-options to the target field. If the query condition is satisfied by the current form values, form-options are applied. Note that dynamic values can be used to compare values of two entries of the form, via the [context injected](#dynamic-context) by the form.
  - `option`: the form-options value to be dynamically injected to the target field

Updating form fields triggers new evaluation of the conditional options, thus updating the form fields accordingly when necessary.

```typescript
type ConditionalOption: {
  property: string
  query: Record<string, unknown>
  option: RHDOptions
}

type RHDOptions = {
    hidden?: boolean;
    hiddenOnUpdate?: boolean;
    hiddenOnInsert?: boolean;
  } & {
    readOnly?: boolean;
    readOnlyOnUpdate?: boolean;
    readOnlyOnInsert?: boolean;
  } & {
    disabled?: boolean;
    disabledOnUpdate?: boolean;
    disabledOnInsert?: boolean;
  }
```

For instance:
```json
{
  "conditionalOptions": [
    {
      "property": "items",
      "query": {
        "budget": {
          "$lt": "{{rawObject values.totalPrice}}" // dynamic queries can be used to compare values of two entries of the form. In this case, `budget` is compared to `totalPrice`. `rawObject` helper can be used to avoid numeric fields to be stringinfied.
        }
      },
      "option": {
        "disable": true
      }
    },
    {
      "property": "isGift",
      "query": {
        "$or": [
          {"status": {"$eq": "OutOfStock"}},
          {"budget": {"$lt": "{{rawObject context.totalPrice}}"}}
        ]
      },
      "option": {
        "hidden": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Using such configuration, field "items" is disabled once field "budget" is lower than field "totalPrice":

```json
{
  "items": ["fork", "spoon", "napkins"],
  "totalPrice": 15,
  "budget": 7
}
```

Once "budget" field is updated to "20", field "items" is no longer disabled.


#### Conditionally reset fields value

For each field it is possible to specify dynamic validity conditions which depend on other fields of the form using the property `conditionalValues`. Fields that do not meet specified conditions have their value reset.

Property `conditionalValues` expects an array of objects with fields:
  - `property`: id of the target field of which to check the value
  - `query`: the MongoDB-like [query](../40_core_concepts.md#inline-queries) to be used against current form values in order to establish whether or not to reset the value of the target field. As long as the query condition is satisfied by the current form values, the field value is considered valid. Once this is no longer the case, the field value is reset. Note that dynamic values can be used to compare values of two entries of the form, via the [context injected](#dynamic-context) by the form.

Updating form fields triggers new evaluation of the conditional values, thus updating the form fields accordingly when necessary.

:::info
Each entry of an array field is singularly matched against the query. Only invalid entries are removed from the array value.
:::

```typescript
type ConditionalOption: {
  property: string
  query: Record<string, unknown>
}
```

```json
{
  "conditionalValues": [
    {
      "property": "city",
      "query": {
        "city.countryName": {
          "$eq": "country" // `city` is an object field with a `countryName` key. If city.countryName is not equal to the value of `country` form field, `city` field is reset.
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "property": "dishes", // dishes is an array. Each entry of dishes is singularly matched against the query!
      "query": {
        "calories": {
          "$lt": "{{rawObject context.maxCalories}}" // assuming dishes is an array of objects, entries of dishes that have a field `calories` grater than the current value of form field `maxCalories` will be automatically removed from the dishes array. Helper `rawObject` is used to avoid numeric values from being stringified
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

For instance, the following form values are valid according to the above configuration:
```json
{
  "country": "Italy",
  "city": {
    "name": "Milano",
    "countryName": "Italy"
  },
  "dishes": [
    {"name": "Tomato", "calories": 30}, 
    {"name": "Pudding", "calories": 300}, 
  ],
  "maxCalories": 400,
}
```

If the value of field "country" were to be updated to "France", the value of "city" field would be reset, since the first entry of `conditionalValues` would be no longer met:
```json
{
  "country": "France",
  // "city" field is now undefined
  "dishes": [
    {"name": "Tomato", "calories": 30}, 
    {"name": "Pudding", "calories": 300}, 
  ],
  "maxCalories": 400,
}
```

If, furthermore, the value of field "maxCalories" were to be updated to "200", the value of "dishes" field would be updated, resulting in one entry being reset:
```json
{
  "country": "France",
  "dishes": [
    {"name": "Tomato", "calories": 30}
  ],
  "maxCalories": 200,
}
```
Note how each entry of array fields is singularly matched against the query. Only invalid entries are removed from the array value.
