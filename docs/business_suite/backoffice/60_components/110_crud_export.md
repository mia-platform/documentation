The CRUD Export client is a business-logic webcomponent that handles the export of an entire collection from a backend [Mia-Platform CRUD Service][crud-service] resource.
It works as `ndjson` fetcher as well as native file downloader which uses browser download native API.

If export must be performed on a CRUD Service resource, an export route is available at `<collection-name>/export` and supports
mongoDB queries as per CRUD Service specifications, along with `__STATE__` filtering.

The CRUD Export listens to any filtering done on the plugin in which it is mounted by accessing any [change-query] event
and by keeping an internal representation of all applied filter.

When the Export CRUD picks up a request for data export (that is, when it listens to an [export-data] event), it initiates the data export.

## How to configure

For its most basic usage, the CRUD Export requires properties `basePath` and `dataSchema` to be specified.

```json
{
  "tag": "bk-export",
  "properties": {
    "basePath": "/orders/export",
    "dataSchema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "_id": {"type": "string"},
        "__STATE__": {"type": "string"},
        "name": {"type": "string"}
      }
    }
  }
}
```
`basePath` is the targeted endpoint for performing data export, while `dataSchema` provides information on the structure of the data of the associated [CRUD Service][crud-service] collection.

### Stream Saver

In order to handle large sized file, on CRUD export data, a service worker is registered to perform local storage persistance operations instead of using large chunks of memory. To do so an external [resource] is needed. You can also use the same resource hosted with `back-kit` JS bundle available at `<back-kit endpoint>/export-service-worker.html`.
In the latter case set `streamSaverIFrameSrc` to the resource endpoint.

```json
{
  "tag": "bk-export",
  "properties": {
    "basePath": "/orders/export",
    "dataSchema": {...},
    "streamSaverIFrameSrc": "/back-kit/{{BACK_KIT_VERSION}}/export-service-worker.html",
  }
}
```

### Export Modes

Export modes are controlled by the boolean prop `nativeDownload`:

- when `false` (default), it performs an HTTP GET and parses the content as ndjson
- when `true`, it delegates to the browser API by creating and clicking an anchor tag with the url specified by the `basePath` property

The CRUD Export notifies the outcome of the export to other components, emitting [success] or [error] events.
If native-download is not enabled (`nativeDownload` property is set to `false`), the events are emitted after the export is over (or on failure).
Otherwise, a result event is emitted right after the download request has been issued, rather than after the download has been completed. This limitation arises due to the nature of native downloads, as there is no built-in mechanism to determine when a download is complete. As a result, the CRUD Export is unable to confirm download completion.
