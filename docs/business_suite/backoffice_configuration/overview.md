This is a **BETA** feature and, as such, is currently under **active development**. Pay attention using this section.

The _Backoffice Configurations_ section of the Mia-Platoform Console is intended to provide a graphical interface to allow technical and non-technical alike to configure the backoffice instance in a no-code way.

This approach reduces backoffice development time by following the user through the entire process, from layout to each page, while always leaving the developer free to manipulate the raw configuration in the [advanced section](/business_suite/backoffice_configuration/structure.md#advanced-configuration) with a live preview panel to see the changes in real time.

The _backoffice Configurations_ section is divided into 3 tabs which:

1. [Pages](/business_suite/backoffice_configuration/structure.md#pages): you can have an overview of the backoffice structure, quickly allowing you to add or remove pages;
1. [Advanced](/business_suite/backoffice_configuration/structure.md#advanced-configuration): it is possible to access to the raw configuration and change ensuring as much flexibility as possible;
1. [Settings](/business_suite/backoffice_configuration/structure#settings): it is possible to configure the global and shared settings.

## Prerequisites

To use the configurator, the [Backoffice application](/runtime_suite/backoffice/overview.md) needs to be deployed in
your project from the marketplace.
