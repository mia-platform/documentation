This is a **BETA** feature and, as such, is currently under **active development**. Pay attention using this section.
:::

The _Backoffice Configurations_ section of the Mia-Platform Console is intended to provide a graphical interface to allow
technical and non-technical users alike to configure a Backoffice instance in a no-code way.

This approach reduces Backoffice development time by helping the user throughout the entire process, from layout design
to compose pages configuration, while leaving the freedom to manipulate the raw configuration in specific advanced
sections with live preview support.

## Prerequisites

To use the configurator, the [Backoffice application](../../runtime_suite/backoffice/overview)
needs to be deployed in your project from the marketplace.
