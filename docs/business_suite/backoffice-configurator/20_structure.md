:::caution
This is a **BETA** feature and, as such, is currently under **active development**. Pay attention using this section.
:::

The first section of the configurator targets the general structure of the Backoffice. It is divided into five tabs:

1. [pages](#pages), where you can overview the Backoffice structure and quickly adding or removing pages,
2. [layout](#layout), where you can configure the Backoffice layout in a no-code fashion,
3. [settings](#settings), where Backoffice global and shared settings reside,
4. [webserver configuration](#webserver-configuration), where settings regarding the underlying server are made accessible, and
5. [advanced](#advanced-configuration), from which it is possible to review and edit the raw configuration.

![First section](img/structure_first-section.png)

## Pages

The first tab is _Pages_, it allows you to view, create, modify, and delete the pages
(i.e., [micro-lc applications](https://micro-lc.io/docs/guides/applications/)) composing your Backoffice.

![Pages](img/structure_pages.png)

### Create new page

Clicking on the _Add new page_ button will open the page creation wizard, which will lead to the page setup thought two
steps, [page details](#page-details) and [page options](#page-options).

#### Page details

On the first step of the wizard you will be asked to specify some basic details regarding the page.

![Page details](img/structure_page-details.png)

The requested fields are:

- _page type_: the type of the new page chosen among
  - [compose](https://micro-lc.io/docs/guides/applications/compose): a dynamically composed page constructed with HTML5
    elements or web components following a provided configuration;
  - [micro-frontend](https://micro-lc.io/docs/guides/applications/parcels): a framework-agnostic component directly managed
    by the orchestrator, which needs to be supplied with the assets entry point;
  - [iFrame](https://micro-lc.io/docs/guides/applications/iframes): an HTML page embedded in an iframe tag with full
    strict encapsulation;
- _id_: the unique identifier of the page;
- _page rendering route_: the path on which the page will be rendered;
- _acl expression_: an optional [logical expression](https://micro-lc.io/add-ons/backend/middleware#acl-application)
  evaluated against user's groups and permissions to determine whether they can view the page.

#### Page options

The second and last step is a type-specific form for page options.

For **compose pages**, available fields are:

- _input mode_: whether the page configuration is saved inline (_inline_ option) or in a separate file (_external_
  option);
- _configurations manager endpoint_ (only if input mode is _external_): endpoint from which the configuration file can
  be fetched;
- _configuration source_ (only if input mode is _external_): name of the file containing the page configuration;
- _template_ (only if input mode is _external_): a configuration template carrying a pre-defined, pre-arranged set of components.

![Page compose options](img/structure_page-compose-options.png)

For **micro-frontend pages**, available fields are:

- _entry_: a JSON object carrying information regarding the
  [entry points](https://micro-lc.io/docs/guides/applications/parcels#usage) of the micro-frontend;
- _properties_: a JSON object of [properties](https://micro-lc.io/docs/guides/applications/parcels#properties) to inject
  in the micro-frontend;
- _inject base_: a flag stating whether a `<base>` tag has to be
  [injected](https://micro-lc.io/docs/guides/applications/parcels#injectbase) in the micro-frontend.

:::tip
The editors will help you writing configurations hinting the correct properties JSON schemas.
:::

![Page micro-frontend options](img/structure_page-micro-frontend-options.png)

For **iFrame pages**, available fields are:

- _source_: the URL of the page to embed;
- _source document_: an inline HTML document to embed (overriding _source_);
- _attributes_: `<iframe>` HTML tag valid
  [attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#attributes) written in a JSON object fashion.

:::tip

![Page iframe options](img/structure_page-iframe-options.png)

### Edit page

The buttons placed in the last column of the page table allows you to interact with existing pages.

From left to right, available actions are:

- _edit page_ (only for compose pages): to open the section for [compose pages configuration](./30_compose-pages.md);
- _edit details_: to re-open the [page creation wizard](#create-new-page) in edit mode;
- _delete_: to delete the page.

## Layout

Through the _Layout_ tab you can configure your Backoffice [layout](https://micro-lc.io/docs/guides/layout) components in a
no-code fashion.

In this tab, the configurator is divided into three sections: 
- a left menu that lists the components composing the layout,
- a central live, interactive preview, and
- a right menu where single component properties can be configured.

![Layout tab](img/structure_layout.png)

### Components list

The drawer on the left of the page shows a list of all the **custom components** (i.e., not-standard HTML tags) used in
the layout configuration. The items will be nested according to the actual DOM tree.

:::tip
The only standard HTML tags allowed to be shown in the left menu are `<header>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`. These
tags – which are containers with a semantic meaning – may help structuring the components tree.
:::

Selecting an item from this list will **highlight** the corresponding component in the [central preview](#live-preview) and
show its **properties** for editing in the [right drawer](#components-properties-editor).

![Left menu selected item](img/structure_layout-left-menu-selected.png)

Components can be **hidden** from the page unchecking the box on their left. Keep in mind that components will just be hidden,
and not removed from the DOM (technically speaking a `display: none` styling will be applied to them). To remove components
from the page entirely you have to resort to the [advanced configuration](#advanced-configuration).

![Left menu hidden item](img/structure_layout-left-menu-hidden.png)

### Live preview

The center of the page shows a live preview of what the final layout will look like.

The preview has two modes, one where you can **interact with the page** as you would do with the final Backoffice, and one
where an overlay is placed on top of the page allowing you to **select components** in page without triggering their
normal click behavior. You can switch between this two modes with the selector in the bottom left corner of the preview
(or with key keyboard shortcut `CTRL + Space`).

![Preview interaction](img/structure_layout-preview-interact.png)

In "select" mode, a click on a component will **highlight** it, **select** it in the [left menu](#components-list), and
show its **properties** for editing in the [right drawer](#components-properties-editor).

Since the preview is a real, functioning Backoffice, components may fire calls to backend or Web APIs (e.g., navigation
events or local storage accesses). To avoid disrupting the configuration flow, these events are caught and mocked. You
will receive **notifications** regarding them – alongside with any **error** that may occur in page – in the notification
center in the bottom right corner of the preview.

### Components properties editor

The drawer on the right of the page allows you to view and edit the properties of the components in page through a
system of forms.

When a component is selected (through the [left menu](#components-list) or the [preview](#live-preview)), the right
menu will show its properties possibly divided into _basic_ and _advanced_ for an easier consultation.

![Right menu](img/structure_layout-right-menu.png)

Different properties will have different means of editing – depending on the type of the property itself –. From a high-level point of view,
they can be divided into **primitive** properties, which can be edited directly from the menu, and **non-primitive** properties,
for which a modal will be spawned.

![Right menu modal](img/structure_layout-right-menu-modal.png)

:::tip
Modals have the option to turn on an **Advanced mode** that will make available a code editor to edit the property.

![Right menu modal advanced mode](img/structure_layout-right-menu-modal-advanced.png)
:::tip

## Settings

The _Settings_ tab collects several Backoffice global settings. The default configurations in most cases should be sufficient,
so it will probably not be necessary to use this section.

### URIs

The URIs section allow you to configure the default
[landing URL](https://micro-lc.io/api/micro-lc-web-component#defaulturl), and the URI of a
[custom composer](https://micro-lc.io/api/micro-lc-web-component#composeruri).

![URIs settings](img/structure_settings-uris.png)

### Custom error pages

In this section you can configure personalized [error pages](https://micro-lc.io/docs/guides/applications/error-pages)
for 4xx and 5xx errors.

![Error pages settings](img/structure_settings-error-pages.png)

For each page you need to provide the status code and the
[configuration](https://micro-lc.io/docs/guides/applications/error-pages#custom-error-pages).

:::tip
The editors will help you writing configurations hinting the correct properties JSON schemas.
:::

### Mount point

This section is dedicated to the personalization of micro-lc [mount point](https://micro-lc.io/docs/guides/layout#mount-point),
both in terms of [selector](https://micro-lc.io/api/micro-lc-web-component#mountpointselector) and of
[configuration](https://micro-lc.io/api/micro-lc-web-component#mountpointselector).

:::tip
The editors will help you writing configurations hinting the correct properties JSON schemas.
:::

![Mount point settings](img/structure_settings-mount-point.png)

### Import map

Here you can specify a global [import map](https://micro-lc.io/api/micro-lc-web-component#importmap).

:::tip
The editors will help you writing configurations hinting the correct properties JSON schemas.
:::

![Import map settings](img/structure_settings-import-maps.png)

### Shared properties

In this final section you can® define global [shared properties](https://micro-lc.io/api/micro-lc-web-component#shared)
for Backoffice page.

:::tip
The editors will help you writing configurations hinting the correct properties JSON schemas.
:::

![Shared properties settings](img/structure_settings-shared.png)

## Webserver configuration

The _Webserver Configuration_ tab gives you access to the configuration of the [service](https://micro-lc.io/add-ons/backend/middleware/)
responsible for serving Backoffice static files and configurations.

### Entry point

Here you can find the HTML file used as entry point for the Backoffice allowing you to fine tune how
[micro-lc web component](https://micro-lc.io/api/micro-lc-web-component) is configured.

![Entry point](img/structure_webserver_entry-point.png)

### Content types

From this section you can [tell the service](https://micro-lc.io/add-ons/backend/middleware#content-type) which
[content type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type) to use when serving files with
specific extentions.

![Entry point](img/structure_webserver_content-types.png)

### Headers

This section allows you to specify [additional headers](https://micro-lc.io/add-ons/backend/middleware#headers) to
include in static files responses.

![Entry point](img/structure_webserver_headers.png)

## Advanced configuration

The _Advanced configuration_ tab is built to give the highest degree of configurability, providing access to the final
JSON configuration. In this visualization the page is divided in two section, a **code editor** on the left and a
**live preview** on the right.

![Advanced configuration](img/structure_advanced.png)

The editor on the left is where the configuration can be viewed and edited. It supports both **JSON** and **YAML** with the
possibility to switch (and convert the content) using the selector in the bottom left corner.

:::tip
The editor will help you writing the configuration hinting the correct JSON schema and validating the content live.
:::

The updates made with the editor are not immediately reflected in the preview on the right: only after the **"Apply"
button** is clicked the modification are saved and the preview is refreshed and aligned with the configuration.

:::warning
Any modification made with the editor **will not be saved** unless the _"Apply"_ button is clicked.
:::

Since the preview is a real, functioning Backoffice, components may fire calls to backend or Web APIs (e.g., navigation
events or local storage accesses). To avoid disrupting the configuration flow, these events are caught and mocked. You
will receive **notifications** regarding them – alongside with any **error** that may occur in page – in the notification
center in the bottom right corner of the page.
