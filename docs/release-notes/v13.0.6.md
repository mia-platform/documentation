## Console

### Improvements

#### Updated Assistant UX

With this release, Mia-Assistant UX has been completely revised, featuring a floating popup you can drag around and resize at will. This improvement has been thought to allow you using the Console while chatting with Mia-Assistant without losing the focus on what you are currently working on!

#### `mlp`

A new version of the Mia-Platform CLI, `mlp`, `v2.0.0-beta` version is available! It comes with the following new features:

* the `deploy` command now will wait for status updates on the released workloads;
* use a ConfigMap as inventory storage instead of a Secret;
* rewrite the flow for managing ExternalSecret and SecretStore resources;
* support `initContainers` env values from Secret and ConfigMap for evaluating the dependencies checksum;
* support kubernetes auth plugins for managing logins via cloud vendors integrations.

### Bug Fix

This version addressed the following bugs:

- more than 20 tags are now available in the design and deploy sections, the tag list limit has been increased to 100;
- it is now possible to deploy a configuration using an interpolated container port
