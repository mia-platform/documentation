### New Features

#### GitHub Actions as CI/CD tool in Console

Starting with this version, Mia-Platform Console supports GitHub Actions as a CI/CD tool.

Within the Providers section, accessible through the Company Overview area, you can now configure a GitHub provider as a CI/CD tool and use it for the deployment of your workload.

For more information, [go to the documentation](/development_suite/deploy/deploy.md).

#### Console CLI

Mia-Platform Console v11 will have its own CLI, let's welcome "miactl"! For the moment, the CLI will only be usable for PaaS users.
The commands supported to date are:

* User authentication
* Context management
* Company list
* Project visualization
* Project deploy and status deploy

For more information, [go to the documentation](/cli/miactl/10_overview.md).

#### Design Overview

From the Design Overview section – which is accessible from the Company Overview – Company Owners and Project Administrators can now aggregated into single tabs resources like Endpoints, Microservices and CRUDs collections, from all Projects across your Company. This data can be saved as custom views and made available for all the members of the Company, who can easily search, sort, and filter those resources.

For more information, [go to the documentation](/development_suite/governance/design-overview.md).

### Improvements

#### Cluster CA as a required field

To improve security, the Certification Authority for Cluster connections has been made mandatory.
It is recommended to check all connections as clusters in the absence of the CA will stop working properly.
