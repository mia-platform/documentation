### Improvements

#### Define Allow rules on Fine-Grained Access Control

Users can now define a list of rules that allow a specific action in Design by specificing an `allowedRuleSet`. By doing so, only changes explicitly permitted by these rules are allowed, while all others are denied.
Discover more about this improvement to the Fine-Grained Access Control functionality in the [dedicated documentation](/development_suite/api-console/api-design/fine-grained-access-control.md).

#### Define multiple actions for a single rule on Fine-Grained Access Control

Users can now configure rules for the Fine-Grained Access Control specifying multiple actions for a single rule.
You can discover more about this feature in the related [documentation page](/development_suite/api-console/api-design/fine-grained-access-control.md).

### Bug Fix

This version addressed the following bugs:

* Fixed issue with project creation when the blueprint uses different values for envPrefix and envId. Before this fix, the created project would have both values set to the same envId from the Company blueprint, while envPrefix was not being applied correctly.
