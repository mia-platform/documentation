### Improvements

#### Define Allow rules on Fine-Grained Access Control

Users can now define a list of rules that allow a specific action in Design by specificing an `allowedRuleSet`. By doing so, only changes explicitly permitted by these rules are allowed, while all others are denied.
Discover more about this improvement to the Fine-Grained Access Control functionality in the [dedicated documentation](/development_suite/api-console/api-design/fine-grained-access-control.md).

#### Define multiple actions for a single rule on Fine-Grained Access Control

Users can now define more rules as an array of strings on the actions field of the processingOptions object for the Fine-Grained Access Control functionality.
You can discover more about this feature in the related [documentation page](/development_suite/api-console/api-design/fine-grained-access-control.md).
