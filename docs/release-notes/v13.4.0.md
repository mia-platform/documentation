## Manage your resources from Mia-Platform Software Catalog


In this release, we’ve enhanced the Software Catalog with new features to improve resource management. Users can now create new items, as well as create new versions for items that support versioning. Additionally, we’ve introduced the ability to delete both individual items and their versions, offering more flexibility in managing resources within the catalog.

#### Bug Fix

This version addressed a few bugs, here is a comprehensive list:

* following the upgrade of GraalJS version, insufficient permissions on the service image prevented the initialization of GraalVM cache and therefore the execution of any custom cast function. Now they can be properly executed again.
* the logic of provided cast function `castToDate` has been overhauled, so that dates represented as Unix timestamp in millisecond that ranges between `-2147483648` (`1969-12-07T03:28:36.352Z`) and `2147483647` (`1970-01-25T20:31:23.647Z`) are now properly converted into their expected date.
