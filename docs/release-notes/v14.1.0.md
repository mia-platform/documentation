## Mia-Assistant gets smarter with real-time Console data via Console MCP Server

Mia-Assistant is now a fully operational agent that uses the [Mia-Platform Console MCP Server](https://github.com/mia-platform/console-mcp-server) to access the Console APIs. This enables to retrieve information about your Company, check the Marketplace, debug your services, fix problems, and automatically perform deployments, all simply by chatting.

As always, it will continue to be your helpful assistant, explaining concepts and planning strategies based on best practices and examples from the official documentation.

## Pin Mia-Assistant and keep it always available by your side

You can now pin the Mia-Assistant chat to keep it open by your side while working in Console.  
This allows you to interact with AI without interrupting your workflow, making it a constant companion ready to support you throughout your daily tasks!

## Console

### Environment Based Configuration Management as Closed Preview

The Environment Based Configuration Management feature, introduced in Beta with **v14.0.0**, will now be available as **Closed Preview** only.
This will allow us to focus on gathering feedback and improving the final user experience before a wider rollout. As a result, automatic migration of Enhanced projects is temporarily disabled, and existing migrated projects will be reverted.

In the meantime, if you are interested in trying out this beta feature, you can reach out to your Mia-Platform referent.

### Improvements

#### Azure DevOps now supported for Infrastructure Projects

Infrastructure Projects now support Azure DevOps as a Git provider.  
This addition allows you to manage your infrastructure configurations directly through Azure DevOps repositories, extending the flexibility of your Git provider integrations.

To discover more, visit the related [documentation page](/console/project-configuration/infrastructure-project.md).

### Back-Lit Library

The new version `v1.5.20` of the back-kit library is available!
