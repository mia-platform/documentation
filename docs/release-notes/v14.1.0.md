## Mia-Assistant gets smarter with real-time Console data via Console MCP Server

Mia-Assistant is now a fully operational agent that uses the [Mia-Platform Console MCP Server](https://github.com/mia-platform/console-mcp-server) to access the Console API. This enables it to retrieve information about your company, check the Marketplace, debug your services, fix problems, and automatically perform deployments, all simply by chatting.

As always, it will continue to be your helpful assistant, explaining concepts and planning strategies based on best practices and examples from the official documentation.

Finally, you can also pin the Mia-Assistant pop-up to the side to keep it open while you work on your projects.

## Console

### Environment Based Configuration Management as Closed Preview

The Environment Based Configuration Management feature, introduced in Beta with **v14.0.0**, will now be available as **Closed Preview** only.
This will allow us to focus on gathering feedback and improving the final user experience before a wider rollout. As a result, automatic migration of Enhanced projects is temporarily disabled, and existing migrated projects will be reverted.

In the meantime, if you are interested in trying out this beta feature, you can reach out to your Mia-Platform referent.
