### New Libraries

We are excited to announce the release of a new open-source library written in TypeScript that will help you easily check Kafka probes in your microservices: [Kafka HealthChecker](https://github.com/mia-platform/kafka-healthchecker). This library is designed to simplify the process of monitoring Kafka by accepting in input a list of producers and consumers and providing two methods that will check if your service is connected to Kafka and able to process new messages.

We have included detailed [documentation](https://docs.mia-platform.eu/docs/runtime_suite_libraries/kafka-healthchecker/overview) to help you get up and running with the library as quickly as possible.

`bk-confirmation-modal` injects `headers` and `credentials` into dynamically mounted buttons

#### Http `bk-buttons` support `loadingOnAction` and `disableOnAction`
`bk-button`s with action of type `http` correctly implement `loadingOnAction` and `disableOnAction` logic

#### Copy-paste actions stop propagation
