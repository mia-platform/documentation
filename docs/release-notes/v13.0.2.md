## Console

### Bug Fix

This version addressed the following bugs:

- fixed bug that caused an error on Flow Manager Configurator's configuration conversion
- fixed a bug causing a malfunction on adding new Dashboards to the Project
- fixed a regression introduced in `v13.0.0` affecting MongoDB Views endpoint routes: all endpoints associated with MongoDB views now correctly expose the appropriate routes based on whether the views are writable or not. For more info, visit the [related documentation](/development_suite/api-console/api-design/mongo_views.md#expose-through-endpoints)
