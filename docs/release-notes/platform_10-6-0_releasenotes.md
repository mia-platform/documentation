## Console

### New Features

#### Fast Data No Code

### New Features (available only for PaaS users)

Along with the traditional Console New Features, we want to dedicate a specific section for all those new features which are exclusive for PaaS users. You can read about them here below:

#### Feature Preview section

PaaS users can now have visibility of features in Console that are still under development and decide to try out them and give us precious feedback.
For instance, once entered this section, PaaS users can now try the `Dynamic Sidebar` of the Design Area. 
To discover more, let's try this feature and tell us what you think! 
This section can be accessed from the Launchbar by clicking on the `Feature Preview` item inside the dropdown menu that appears when hovering over the user avatar.

#### User Preferences section

We have introduced a new section named `User Preferences` in which PaaS users can customize their experience in Console according to their own preferences. For instance, inside this section, it is now possible to manage the receipt of an invitation email that is sent when added to a Company. This section is accessible from the Launchbar when hovering over the user avatar.
