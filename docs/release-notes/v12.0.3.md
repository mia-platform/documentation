## Fast Data

### Bug Fix

This version addresses a bug that causes the automatic regeneration of Real-Time Updater config maps to use all `pr-update` topic definitions retrieved from the Console configuration, even if these definitions are left empty, as `pr-update` events are not required for these projections.

:::warning
If you have enabled the emission of `pr-update` events in a Real-Time Updater or a Projection Storer but not all projections should emit the events, make sure to clear the unused `pr-update` topic inputs inside the details page of each excluded projection.
