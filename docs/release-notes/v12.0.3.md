## Console

### Bug Fix

This version addressed the following bugs:

* fixed a bug that caused project deployment to fail if the user was using Azure Key Vault or Vault as a secret manager;

## Fast Data

### Bug Fix

This version addresses a bug that causes the automatic regeneration of Real-Time Updater config maps to use all `pr-update` topic definitions retrieved from the Console configuration, even if these definitions are left empty, as `pr-update` events are not required for these projections.

:::warning
If you have enabled the emission of `pr-update` events in a Real-Time Updater or a Projection Storer but not all projections should emit the events, make sure to clear the unused `pr-update` topic inputs inside the [details page](/fast_data/configuration/projections.md#pr-update-topic) of each excluded projection.
