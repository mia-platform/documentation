:::info
Mia-Platform Console v12.1.0 is **now in Preview!**

Console SaaS users can try out v12.1.0 latest improvements in Preview! Open a Service Request to ask for the creation of a sandbox Company in case you do not have access to any Company.

For self-hosted installations, please read the [following guidelines](#how-to-update-your-console).
:::

## Console

### New Console backoffice configuration using Mia-Platform Microfrontend Composer

Console CMS has been replaced with a new backoffice adopting [Mia-Platform Microfrontend Composer](/microfrontend-composer/what-is.md). 
At runtime, there will be micro-lc that replaces the previously adopted cms-backend, cms-site and v1-adapter.

For self-hosted installations, take a look at the information given on the [How to upgrade Console guide](/infrastructure/self-hosted/installation-chart/100-how-to-upgrade.md#v12---version-upgrades).

### Complete Company access management through `miactl`

The new version of `miactl` allows complete management of all identities access to the Company.
More specifically, starting from today it will be possible to add, modify and remove any type of identity (User, Service Account, Group) simply through command line.

For more information on the specific commands introduced, please [go to the documentation](/cli/miactl/30_commands.md).

### Improvements

#### Improved User session management in Console

The Console now features a new modal that activates upon session expiry, preventing further interactions and allowing users to seamlessly re-login, ensuring their ongoing work is not lost.

#### Enhanced default branch management for Template and Example creation

The default branch handling during pipeline setup from Marketplace Templates and Examples creation has been improved. Now, when creating those resources, if the branch is not specified within the pipeline definition, the provider will dynamically retrieve the repository's default branch in which the pipeline is located, instead of statically selecting the master branch.

### Bug Fix

This version addressed a few bugs, here is a comprehensive list:

* fixed a bug that caused configurations not to be saved if removal of certain types of microservices had previously been performed.
