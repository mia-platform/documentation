#### New Apply Extension Body Schema

<details>
  <summary>Migration guide from legacy to new apply body format</summary>

Starting from the following legacy format as example:

```json
{
  "extensionId": "my-extension-id",
  "name": "My Extension",
  "entry": "https://example.com/",
  "extensionType": "iframe",
  "contexts": ["project"],
  "description": "Example Extension",
  "permissions": [],
  "routes": [
    {
      "destinationPath": "/",
      "icon": {
        "name": "PiProjectorScreenChartLight"
      },
      "id": "my-route",
      "labelIntl": {
        "en": "My Extension",
        "it": "La mia estensione"
      },
      "order": 200.0,
      "locationId": "project",
      "parentId": "my-menu-group"
    },
    {
      "id": "my-menu-group",
      "labelIntl": {
        "en": "My Menu Group",
        "it": "Il mio gruppo menu"
      },
      "locationId": "project",
      "renderType": "category",
      "order": 100.0,
    },
  ]
}
```

it is possible to migrate to new format properties following the mapping explained by this table:

| New schema properties | Legacy schema properties   |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| extensionId           | extensionId                |
| name                  | name                       |
| entry                 | entry                      |
| type                  | extensionType              |
| activationContexts    | contexts                   |
| description           | description                |
| permissions           | permission                 |
| destination.id        | mainRoute.locationId       |
| destination.path      | mainRoute.destinationPath  |
| iconName              | mainRoute.icon.name        |
| menu.id               | mainRoute.id               |
| menu.labelIntl        | mainRoute.labelIntl        |
| menu.order            | mainRoute.order            |
| category.id           | mainRoute.parentId         |
| category.labelIntl    | categoryRoute.labelIntl    |
| category.order        | categoryRoute.order        |

where:

- **mainRoute** is the last route in the `routes` legacy properties that does not define renderType, so the route with `my-route` ID.
- **categoryRoute** is the last route in the `routes` legacy properties that defines renderType as `category`. This is the custom category registered with the extension and it could be omitted in the request, in fact in this case the new `category` properties will have only the `id` defined taken by the `mainRoute.parentId`. In the example above there is a custom category and corresponding to the route with `my-menu-group` ID.

After migration the new body format is the following:

```json
{
  "extensionId": "my-extension-id",
  "name": "My Extension",
  "entry": "https://example.com/",
  "type": "iframe",
  "activationContexts": ["project"],
  "description": "Example Extension",
  "permissions": [],
  "destination": {
      "id": "project",
      "path": "/",
  },
  "iconName": "PiProjectorScreenChartLight",
  "menu": {
    "id": "my-route",
    "labelIntl": {
      "en": "My Extension",
      "it": "La mia estensione"
    },
    "order": 200.0,
  },
  "category": { 
      "id": "my-menu-group",
      "labelIntl": {
        "en": "My Menu Group",
        "it": "Il mio gruppo menu"
      },
      "order": 100.0,
  }
}
```
