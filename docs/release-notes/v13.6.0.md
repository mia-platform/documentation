## Console

### Improvements

#### GitHub App as new authentication type

It is now possible to use GitHub Apps as an authentication method for connecting to GitHub type providers in Console.
You will only need to configure the provider by selecting the respective credential type and the respective information to be able to use them as an authentication method for the provider.


For more information, visit the [documentation page](/console/company-configuration/providers/configure-provider.mdx#supported-credential-types).


#### New Shapes and Notes features in Flow Manager Configurator

You can now add and customize shapes and notes on the canvas. Create, resize, name, and change the color of shapes, and add notes with customizable content and colors directly from the canvas.

#### Import from Kubernetes

You can now import a Kubernetes namespace into an existing Console project using miactl. This makes it seamless to onboard pre-existing workloads without needing to recreate them from scratch.

#### `mlp`

A new version of the Mia-Platform CLI, `mlp`, `v2.0.0` is available! It comes with the following new features:

* use configmap instead of secret as inventory storage with an improved algorithm for reducing errors during reconciliation loop
* now the deployment process is kept on waiting that all the resources are correctly applied
* rewrite of the cli for resolving several edge cases bugs

#### `miactl`

A new version of `miactl`, `v0.17.0` is available! It comes with the following new features:

* update deploy trigger command to handle deployment pipeline failure
* project import command

### Bug Fix

This version addressed the following bugs:

* we fixed an issue that caused Advanced configurations to be lost when restoring changes within the revision

## Fast Data

### Fast Data Runtime Management

Fast Data Control Plane Operator has been updated to [v0.3.0](/runtime_suite/fast-data-control-plane-operator/changelog.md).

#### Breaking change

Control Plane Operator now starts accepting connections incoming from Fast Data workloads <u>only after</u> it has connected itself to the main Control Plane instance.  
In order to update to v0.3.0 of Control Plane Operator, check the specific [Migration Guide](/fast_data/runtime_management/control_plane_operator.mdx#migration-guides).

:::caution
Consequently, both *Fast Data Control Plane Application* services and *Fast Data workloads* **must be updated** to the version supporting this behavior.
:::

For more information, visit the [compatibility matrix documentation page](/fast_data/runtime_management/compatibility_matrix.md#service-latest-versions).

## Data Catalog

Data Catalog Application has been updated with new features and small improvements.

### New Features

#### Metadata Inheritance

:::caution
This feature is currently in **BETA**, so pay attention when using it.  

This feature is supported by versions of [Fabric BFF](/data_catalog/data_catalog_fabric_bff.mdx), [Open Lineage](/data_catalog/data_catalog_open_lineage.mdx), [Data Catalog Frontend](/data_catalog/frontend/overview.mdx) >= v0.3.x.  
Give a look at the [Data Catalog service latest versions](/data_catalog/compatibility_matrix.md#service-latest-versions).
:::

The Metadata Inheritance feature allows to propagate metadata from parent assets (SoR, Tables) to child assets (Tables, Columns), ensuring consistency and simplifying governance.  
To know more about how to manage inheritance of custom properties, give a look at the specific [documentation page](/data_catalog/frontend/data_catalog_assets.mdx#metadata-inheritance).

### Improvements

- For data assets retrieved from ODBC connections, based on the provider type, from now on the UI shows useful information about namespace properties (system of record, catalog name, schema, owner, table), if present
- At the SoR-level lineage canvas, when inspecting the Jobs list between two System of Records, both `Source table` and `Target table` filters allow to select exclusively the tables involved in those displayed Jobs list
- Inside the virtual Jobs detail, the source and the target table are displayed; moreover, for a quick navigation, it is possible to click onto the source/target table name to navigate on its detail
- Virtual assets (both SoRs and Tables) can also be deleted directly from the Lineage canvas section

## Microfrontend Composer

The new version `v1.5.15` of the back-kit library is available!

Refer to back-kit [changelog](/microfrontend-composer/back-kit/changelog.md) for finer-grained details of new versions.

### Back-Kit Library

#### Bug Fix

- Fixed escaping of char `&` in `editor` and `html-editor` format.

## Marketplace

### Marketplace Updates

#### AI RAG Chat

The application _AI RAG Chat_ has been updated with a couple of minor fixes on the backend service:

- the backend service is now called `rag-chatbot-api` and it is available as a Mia-Platform _plugin_, making it more easier to install and manage
- at application startup, the embeddings collection is automatically created if it does not exist
- the API to generate embeddings from file now supports markdown files with extension `.mdx`

:::note
The `rag-chatbot-api` plugin is available as a standalone plugin in the _Marketplace_.
:::

#### AI RAG Chat Template

We have released a new application, called _AI RAG Chat Template_: it is identical to _AI RAG Chat_, but the backend service is available as a Mia-Platform _template_: when installed, the source code (available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mia-platform/ai-rag-template)) will be forked in a new repository to allow you complete customization.
