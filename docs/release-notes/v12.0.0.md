## Console

## Fast Data

### Fast Data Configurator

#### Unique values for ingestion topics and pr-update topics

To further improve the automatic configuration of the Fast Data, from now on when configuring a Projection inside a System of Record it is possible to set only one _ingestion topic_ and only one _pr-update topic_, instead of a topic for each environment.

Every new projection created will automatically set the ingestion topic to the pattern `{tenantId}.{projectId}.{systemId}.{projectionId}.ingestion` and the pr-update topic with `{tenantId}.{projectId}.{systemId}.{projectionId}.pr-update`. These are editable and it is possible to use environment variables for the entire name or part of the name.

:::info
A migration will perform a check to the ingestion topic names of existing projections. If they share the same name among environments, this name will be used as the unique ingestion topic name. Otherwise, a public environment variable will be created with the values: its name will follow the pattern `FAST_DATA_{topicName}_INGESTION_TOPIC` and it will be also set in the projection configuration page. 

The same approach is used for the pr-update topics, and the eventual public variable generated will be called `FAST_DATA_{topicName}_PR_UPDATE_TOPIC`.

The environment variable(s) can be found in the _Public Variables_ section and they are editable. 

An empty commit is required to save these modifications.
:::

:::info
Because of these updates, the public variables of the invariant topic map (usually named `FAST_DATA_{realTimeUpdaterName}_INVARIANT_TOPIC_MAP`) are not used anymore by the Real-Time Updater services attached to a System of Record.

These variables are still available as set as editable. They can be deleted after verifying that they are not used any longer.

#### Single View Trigger Generator services attachable to Single Views

The Single View Creator detail page, used to configure the config maps of the Single View Creator service, now includes a new tab that allow to attach also a [Single View Trigger Generator] to the service, and therefore to the Single View.

<!-- TODO: update image -->
![Single View Trigger Generator page](../fast_data/img/)

Attaching a Single View Trigger Generator will simplify the configuration of the service itself by automatically setting the same ER Schema config map used in the Single View Creator, and including a dedicated space where to configure the [Kafka Projection Updates](/fast_data/configuration/config_maps/kafka_projection_updates.md) and the [Projection Changes Schema](/fast_data/configuration/config_maps/projection_changes_schema.md) config map.

:::info
This configuration cannot be used in case the Kafka Projection Updates uses manual strategies
:::

#### Upsert/Delete Strategy configuration page
feat:
The Single View Creator detail pag includes another tab, allowing the user to simplify the configuration of the _Upsert strategy and the Delete strategy_:

<!-- TODO: update image -->
![Upsert/Delete Strategy page](../fast_data/img/)

Any update here will be reflected to the Single View Creator service after saving the configuration. For more information, [read more in the dedicated documentation page](/fast_data/configuration/single_view_creator.md#upsert-delete-strategies).
