## Console

### New Features

#### Enhanced Project Workflow and GitOps support

The [Enhanced Project Workflow](/development_suite/set-up-infrastructure/enhanced-project-workflow.md) is a BETA feature that aims to improve the developer experience when working with the Console. It comes with significant performance improvements on the main workflows in Design Area, thanks to the new configuration management strategy, and unlocks the possibility to adopt a **pull-based deployment strategy**.

In fact, with the Enhanced Workflow, configurations are generated and committed to the Git repository only during the deployment process. This means you can use a GitOps tool such as ArgoCD to automatically deploy them to your cluster, without the need to trigger any CI/CD pipelines.

:::info
To learn more about **GitOps-based deployment**, check out the dedicated [documentation page](/development_suite/deploy/gitops-based/index.md)
:::

#### Listeners management

From now on you can choose to **expose your endpoints on different Listeners** to map them to different exposed domains. In the dedicated section of the Design area, you can map each Listener to a single port in order to route external client requests towards resources exposed on your cluster. You can also see a general overview of which endpoints are exposed on which listeners, thanks to the dedicated Endpoints tab.
:::info
To learn more about Listener management, visit the dedicated [documentation page](development_suite/api-console/api-design/listeners.md)
:::
:::caution
At the moment, Listeners are only available for Projects using an **Envoy API Gateway**.

#### Azure Key Vault as a secret manager on Console

The console is now properly integrated to use Azure Key Vault as a secret manager.
Therefore, it will now be possible to configure an "Azure Key Vault" provider from the respective section in a quick and easy way, so that all projects can use this provider as a secret manager.

To learn more about Listener management, visit the dedicated [documentation page](console/project-configuration/manage-environment-variables/manage-environment-variables-with-akv.md)

#### New Navigation in Feature Preview (Only for PaaS users)

Starting with this release it will be possiible to activate the Console-wide new navigation experience by activating the respective Feature Preview (which can be activated from the User panel).

This new interface will allow you to navigate through the sections more effectively and with a new look and feel: in particular the new side menu it will be visible from any screen, ad will allow you to move easily between sections including shortcuts for the different areas of the Console and other useful tools previously visible in the upper part of the interface.

:::caution
The New Navigation is currently only for PaaS users and it's not compatible with the Dynamic Sidebar

## Fast Data

### Fast Data Configurator

#### Import and Export of Fast Data resources between projects

It is now possible to export Fast Data resources (such as ER schemas, Single Views and Systems of Record) from a project and import them inside another one by clicking the `Import / Export` button placed on the top right bar of the Systems of Record and Single Views pages.

![Export modal](../fast_data/configuration/img/fast_data_ie_export_modal.png)

The `Export` modal allows to select resources from the project current configuration and export them inside a `.json` file. This file can be later used as an input for the `Import` modal, which allows to import data as a reference (creating a read-only copy of the resource) or as a resource (adding the resource to the project configuration as if it was created inside the project).

The new `Import / Export` feature can be useful to handle Fast Data resources split between projects and to clone resources from one project to another one, without having to recreate them from scratch.

:::tip
You might need to enable this feature inside the Feature Preview of your Project Settings in order to use it.

#### Unique values for ingestion topics and pr-update topics

To further improve the automatic configuration of the Fast Data, from now on when configuring a Projection inside a System of Record it is possible to set only one _ingestion topic_ and only one _pr-update topic_, instead of a topic for each environment.

Every new projection created will automatically set the ingestion topic to the pattern `{tenantId}.{projectId}.{systemId}.{projectionId}.ingestion` and the pr-update topic with `{tenantId}.{projectId}.{systemId}.{projectionId}.pr-update`. These are editable and it is possible to use environment variables for the entire name or part of the name. This lets you differentiate topics for each environment leveraging on the usage of environment variables.

:::info
A migration will perform a check on the ingestion topic names of existing projections. If they share the same name among environments, this name will be used as the unique ingestion topic name. Otherwise, a public environment variable will be created with the values: its name will follow the pattern `FAST_DATA_{topicName}_INGESTION_TOPIC` and it will be also set in the projection configuration page. 

The same approach is used for the pr-update topics, and the eventual public variable generated will be called `FAST_DATA_{topicName}_PR_UPDATE_TOPIC`.

The environment variable(s) can be found in the _Public Variables_ section and they are editable. 

An empty commit is required to save these modifications.
:::

:::info
Because of these updates, the public variables of the invariant topic map (usually named `FAST_DATA_{realTimeUpdaterName}_INVARIANT_TOPIC_MAP`) are not used anymore by the Real-Time Updater services attached to a System of Record.

These variables are still available as set as editable. They can be deleted after verifying that they are not used any longer.
:::

#### Single View Trigger Generator services attachable to Single Views

The Single View Creator detail page, used to configure the config maps of the Single View Creator service, now includes a new tab that allow to attach also a [Single View Trigger Generator] to the service, and therefore to the Single View.

![Single View Trigger Generator page](../fast_data/configuration/img/svtg-configuration.png)

Attaching a Single View Trigger Generator will simplify the configuration of the service itself by automatically setting the same ER Schema config map used in the Single View Creator, and including a dedicated space where to configure the [Kafka Projection Updates](/fast_data/configuration/config_maps/kafka_projection_updates.md) and the [Projection Changes Schema](/fast_data/configuration/config_maps/projection_changes_schema.md) config map.

:::info
This configuration cannot be used in case the Kafka Projection Updates uses manual strategies
:::

#### Upsert/Delete Strategy configuration page

The Single View Creator detail page includes another tab, allowing the user to simplify the configuration of the _Upsert strategy and the Delete strategy_:

![Upsert/Delete Strategy page](../fast_data/configuration/img/upsert-delete-strategy.png)

Any update here will be reflected in the Single View Creator service after saving the configuration. For more information, [read more on the dedicated documentation page](/fast_data/configuration/single_view_creator.md#upsert-delete-strategies). 

#### Bug Fix

This version addressed a few bugs, here is a comprehensive list:

* solved an issue that causes to regenerate indexes and information of Projection Changes collections of Real-Time Updater attached to the System of Record
* solved an issue that caused the No Code ER Schema to stop working if the JSON was completely empty
* now it's not possible to create Projections and Single Views with names longer than 80 characters, complying with the MongoDB CRUD requirements

### Fast Data Services

#### Projection Storer

The version `v1.0.0` of the _Projection Store_ is now available!

This is a new service that can be employed in Fast Data _event-driven_ architecture in place of
Real-Time Updater plugin.  
Similarly to the Real-Time Updater plugin, Projection Storer consumes change events as ingestion messages,
transforms them into projection records, filters and validates each of their fields and eventually saves them onto the specified storage system, emitting a proper notification for downstream components.

For more information check out the service [documentation](/fast_data/projection_storer.md)

#### Single View Trigger Generator

The new version `v3.1.3` of the _Single View Trigger Generator_ is available!

#### Improvements

* introduce new property `singleViewName` in `sv-trigger` message to link the message value to a specific Single View
