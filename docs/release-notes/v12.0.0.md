## Console

## Fast Data

### Fast Data Configurator

#### Unique values for ingestion topics and pr-update topics

To further improve the automatic configuration of the Fast Data, from now on when configuring a Projection inside a System of Record it is possible to set only one _ingestion topic_ and only one _pr-update topic_, instead of a topic for each environment.

Every new projection created will automatically set the ingestion topic to the pattern `{tenantId}.{projectId}.{systemId}.{projectionId}.ingestion` and the pr-update topic with `{tenantId}.{projectId}.{systemId}.{projectionId}.pr-update`. These are editable and it is possible to use environment variables for the entire name or part of the name. This lets you differentiate topics for each environment leveraging on the usage of environment variables.

:::info
A migration will perform a check to the ingestion topic names of existing projections. If they share the same name among environments, this name will be used as the unique ingestion topic name. Otherwise, a public environment variable will be created with the values: its name will follow the pattern `FAST_DATA_{topicName}_INGESTION_TOPIC` and it will be also set in the projection configuration page. 

The same approach is used for the pr-update topics, and the eventual public variable generated will be called `FAST_DATA_{topicName}_PR_UPDATE_TOPIC`.

The environment variable(s) can be found in the _Public Variables_ section and they are editable. 

An empty commit is required to save these modifications.
:::

:::info
Because of these updates, the public variables of the invariant topic map (usually named `FAST_DATA_{realTimeUpdaterName}_INVARIANT_TOPIC_MAP`) are not used anymore by the Real-Time Updater services attached to a System of Record.

These variables are still available as set as editable. They can be deleted after verifying that they are not used any longer.

#### Single View Trigger Generator services attachable to Single Views

The Single View Creator detail page, used to configure the config maps of the Single View Creator service, now includes a new tab that allow to attach also a [Single View Trigger Generator] to the service, and therefore to the Single View.

![Single View Trigger Generator page](../fast_data/configuration/img/svtg-configuration.png)

Attaching a Single View Trigger Generator will simplify the configuration of the service itself by automatically setting the same ER Schema config map used in the Single View Creator, and including a dedicated space where to configure the [Kafka Projection Updates](/fast_data/configuration/config_maps/kafka_projection_updates.md) and the [Projection Changes Schema](/fast_data/configuration/config_maps/projection_changes_schema.md) config map.

:::info
This configuration cannot be used in case the Kafka Projection Updates uses manual strategies
:::

#### Upsert/Delete Strategy configuration page

The Single View Creator detail pag includes another tab, allowing the user to simplify the configuration of the _Upsert strategy and the Delete strategy_:

![Upsert/Delete Strategy page](../fast_data/configuration/img/upsert-delete-strategy.png)

Any update here will be reflected to the Single View Creator service after saving the configuration. For more information, [read more in the dedicated documentation page](/fast_data/configuration/single_view_creator.md#upsert-delete-strategies). 

#### Bug Fix
