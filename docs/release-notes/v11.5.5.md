## Console

### Customised branding in the console 

From now on it will be possible to set your custom brand in the Console, so that it replaces Mia-Platform's brand both within the Console and in the login pages. To enable this customisation, please contact your product contact person.

## How to update your Console

For on-premise installations, please contact your Mia-Platform referent and upgrade your _Console Helm Chart_ to `v9.5.5-hotfix.2`.
