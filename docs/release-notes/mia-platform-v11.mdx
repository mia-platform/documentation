Simplify Complexity.

## Console

### Providers Management

### Machine-to-Machine Authentication

Service accounts are an essential component of many IT environments, allowing applications and services to access various resources and perform operations without the need for human intervention.
Mia-Platform Console allows to create and manage service accounts, useful for automating processes that previously had to be done by a human user.
Assign roles and permissions to service accounts lets you to improve speed, reliability and scalability of your CI/CD workflows.
For instance, service accounts are useful for applications that require continuous monitoring, reporting, and data processing, or you can give the permission to trigger automatic deploys, which can significantly streamline the process of deploying code changes to an application.
Service accounts are also potentially great for security. Using service accounts promotes the separation of roles and responsibilities, which reduces the risk of credential misuse or theft.

## Fast Data

### Er Schema No Code Configuration

Simplifying how it is possible to configure the services from the console has been the main focus of the last period. The Er Schema No Code configuration for Fast Data moves in this direction. From the dedicated Er Schema section inside the System of Record page, it is now possible to configure and build your Er Schema with an easy-to-use and user-friendly interface! As you can see from the picture, with the drag&drop functionality, it is possible to import projections inside a canvas, define their relationships, and the rules that connect the projections to each other.

Find out more about this functionality in the official documentation! <!---TODO add link to the documentation-->
