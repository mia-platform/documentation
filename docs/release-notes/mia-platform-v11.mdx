Mia-Platform v11, Simplify Complexity.

## Console

### Providers Management

We have developed Mia-Platform Console so that it can integrate properly with the best and most widely used tools and providers on the market. 
Therefore, to better enhance this integration, we have introduced a proper governance system, and this feature has precisely this goal: to make it easier to keep constantly documented and ordered all the Providers you want the Console to use. Through the new dedicated section - named "Providers" - inside the "Company Overview" area it will be possible to manage the creation, configuration, and editing of the providers used by Mia-Platform Console (GitProvider, Secret Manager and CI/CD Tools).

Furthermore, again through the same section, it will be possible to set the default Providers that will be used in all new projects created in the respective company. This will enhance the governance of Company Owners on all the Projects of their Companies, granting them better control over the management of company tools.

### Machine-to-Machine Authentication

Service accounts are an essential component of many IT environments, as they allow applications and services to access various resources and perform operations without the need for human intervention.
Assigning roles and permissions to Service accounts lets you improve the speed, reliability, and scalability of your CI/CD workflows.
Service accounts may be suitable for those applications that require continuous monitoring, reporting, and data processing; alternatively, you can use them also to streamline the process of deploying code changes to an application, for instance by assigning them permissions to trigger automatic deploys.
Moreover, they can also be great for security concerns: using Service accounts promotes the separation of roles and responsibilities, which reduces the risk of credential misuse or theft.
With Mia-Platform Console you can now create and manage Service accounts, and start to implement automated processes with machine-to-machine communication.

### Webhooks Management

Each user has different needs, especially depending on their business. We believe it is essential to give each user the ability to manage additional custom flows when certain events occur in the Console.

For this reason, we have introduced the possibility for the user to subscribe to specific events in Console via HTTP webhooks, through our CMS. With this feature it will be possible to configure custom HTTP calls that will be triggered when the respective event takes place in Console

For now, the supported events are:

* Project Creation  
* Service Creation

### New Cluster connection

Mia-Platform v11 supports all the best and most widely used Runtime Services on the market.

Within the Console, the experience of connecting a Cluster has been completely improved, so that you can choose your configuration from a predefined set of officially supported Runtime Services divided by vendor and have a clearer and more intuitive experience.

### Enhanced Runtime area

The Runtime Area has been enhanced with several new k8s resources: after the introduction of Pods and Namespaces sections, we are now welcoming also the Deployments, Services, Cronjobs, and Jobs sections. You can now monitor all these k8s resources and their relative properties directly on Mia-Platform Console.

### Support GitHub Actions

This new version of the console brings with it a very used and appreciated tool in the market: from now on you can use and configure GitHub Actions as CI/CD Tool in Console so that they are used to deploy your workloads.

### Feature Preview

Keep up with innovation and try out our new Console Features available in Preview exclusively for our Console SaaS users.

### Design Overview

In the Design Overview section – accessible from the Company Overview – you can now have access to a rich set of visualization tools which can help you aggregate resources from all Projects across your Company into a single table. From this section you can easily search, sort, and filter Endpoints, Microservices and CRUDs collections, and save them as custom views for easy access and share this data to all Company's users.

## Fast Data

### ER Schema No Code Configuration

We understand the importance of a user-friendly interface, and that's why we have introduced the Er Schema No Code configuration for Fast Data.

With this new feature, you can easily configure and build your ER Schema directly from the System of Record page. The ER Schema section is now more intuitive and easy to use, making it simpler to define relationships between projections and the rules that connect them to one another.

One of the key advantages of this feature is the drag and drop functionality, which allows you to import projections into a canvas quickly. From there, you can easily define their relationships and create rules that connect them to one another.

Overall, the Er Schema No Code configuration for Fast Data is a game-changer in terms of simplifying the process of configuring services from the console, making it easier than ever to create the Er Schema they need to power their data-driven applications.

### Fast Data Connectors

We are thrilled to announce one of the most requested feature to Fast Data, featuring the addition of new plug-and-play connectors that make it easier than ever to connect and manage your data.

With these new connectors, you can seamlessly integrate your data from a wide variety of sources, including databases, bucket storages and more, leveraging on Debezium CDC and some other hand-made connectors.

We understand that managing data can be a complex and time-consuming process, which is why we integrated these connectors to be as easy to use as possible. With just a few clicks, you can quickly and easily set up connections to your data sources, and start managing your data in a way that makes sense for your business.

At the heart of Fast Data product is a commitment to helping our customers unlock the full potential of their data. With these new plug-and-play connectors, we are proud to take another step towards achieving this goal, and we look forward to seeing the many ways our customers will use them to drive their businesses forward.

### Bucket Storage Support

Bucket Storage Support will provide users with a simple and reliable way to store and manage their data. Users can now easily store their data to a cloud storage bucket (Google and S3-like buckets are supported) and can be sure that their data is securely stored and easily accessible whenever they need it. This new feature also makes it easy to restore data wehnever is needed.

Re-ingesting data has never been easier with the Bucket Storage Support feature. Users can now easily re-ingest their data into the system, which means they can restore data previously removed with few actions.

Lastly, the Bucket Storage Support feature makes it possible to offload the projections storage. This means that users can now offload their projections relying on the data stored in this separate storage bucket, which reduces the amount of storage needed in the main system. This can lead to significant cost savings and improved system performance.

In summary, the Bucket Storage Support feature provides users with greater control over their data and makes it easier to backup, re-ingest, and manage their data.

## Backoffice

### Backoffice Low Code / No Code configurator

This powerful feature empowers users to easily configure frontend pages in a no-code manner and easily configure properties to configure all the back-kit components and micro-lc in the same page.

With this new feature, users can now quickly and easily customize the look and feel of their Backoffice pages without the need for technical skills or coding knowledge. This means that non-tech people can now have more control over their Backoffice design and functionality, resulting in a more streamlined and efficient workflow.

The Backoffice Configurator No Code feature allows users to easily configure properties such as colors, layouts, and also enables them to configure all the back-kit components in the same page. This means that users can now quickly create custom Backoffice pages that are tailored to their specific needs and preferences.

Overall, the Backoffice Configurator No Code is a powerful and versatile tool that enables users to easily configure and customize their Backoffice pages with no technical skills or coding knowledge required.
