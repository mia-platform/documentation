Service accounts are an essential component of many IT environments, allowing applications and services to access various resources and perform operations without the need for human intervention.

For instance, service accounts are useful for applications that require continuous monitoring, reporting, and data processing, or you can give the permission to trigger automatic deploys, which can significantly streamline the process of deploying code changes to an application.
