Mia-Platform V11, Simplify Complexity.

## Console

### Providers Management

We have developed the Mia-Platform Console so that it can integrates properly with the best and most widely used tools and providers on the market. 

However, this integration needs a proper governance system, and this feature has just that goal: to make it easier to keep constantly documented and ordered all the Providers you want the console to use. Through the new dedicated section - named "Providers" - inside the "Company Overview" area it will be possible to manage the creation, configuration, and editing of the providers used by Mia-Platform Console (GitProvider, Secret Manager and CI/CD Tools).

Furthermore, again through the same section, it will be possible to set the default Providers that will be used in all new projects created in the respective company. This will enhance the governance of Company Owners on all the Projects of their Companies, granting them better control over the management of company tools.

### Machine-to-Machine Authentication

Service accounts are an essential component of many IT environments, as they allow applications and services to access various resources and perform operations without the need for human intervention.
Assigning roles and permissions to Service accounts lets you improve the speed, reliability, and scalability of your CI/CD workflows.
Service accounts may be suitable for those applications that require continuous monitoring, reporting, and data processing; alternatively, you can use them also to streamline the process of deploying code changes to an application, for instance by assigning them permissions to trigger automatic deploys.
Moreover, they can also be great for security concerns: using Service accounts promotes the separation of roles and responsibilities, which reduces the risk of credential misuse or theft.
With Mia-Platform Console you can now create and manage Service accounts, and start to implement automated processes with machine-to-machine communication.

### Webhooks Management

Each user has different needs, especially dependent on their business. We believe it is critical to give each user the ability to manage any additional custom flows as certain events occur in the console.

For this reason, we have introduced the ability for the user to be able to subscribe to specific events in Console via HTTP webhooks via our CMS, so that custom HTTP calls can be configured that will be triggered when the respective event occurs in Console.

For now, the supported events are:

-Project Creation
-Service Creation

### New Cluster connection

Mia-Platform v11 supports all the best and most widely used Runtime Services on the market.

Within the console, the experience of connecting a Cluster has been completely improved so that you can choose your configuration from a predefined set of officially supported Runtime Services divided by vendor for a clearer and more intuitive experience.

### Enhanced Runtime area

The Runtime Area has been enhanced with several new k8s resources: after the introduction of Pods and Namespaces sections, we are now welcoming also the Deployments, Services, Cronjobs, and Jobs sections. You can now monitor all these k8s resources and their relative properties directly on Mia-Platform Console.

### Support GitHub Actions

This new version of the console brings with it a very used and appreciated tool in the market: from now on you can use and configure GitHub Actions as CI/CD Tool in Console so that they are used to deploy your workloads.

## Fast Data

### Er Schema No Code Configuration

Simplifying how it is possible to configure the services from the console has been the main focus of the last period. The Er Schema No Code configuration for Fast Data moves in this direction. 

From the dedicated Er Schema section inside the System of Record page, it is now possible to configure and build your Er Schema with an easy-to-use and user-friendly interface! As you can see from the picture, with the drag&drop functionality, it is possible to import projections inside a canvas, define their relationships, and the rules that connect the projections to each other.

### Fast Data Connectors

We are thrilled to announce one of the most requested feature to Fast Data, featuring the addition of new plug-and-play connectors that make it easier than ever to connect and manage your data.

With these new connectors, you can seamlessly integrate your data from a wide variety of sources, including databases, bucket storages and more, leveraging on Debezium CDC and some other hand-made connectors.

We understand that managing data can be a complex and time-consuming process, which is why we integrated these connectors to be as easy to use as possible. With just a few clicks, you can quickly and easily set up connections to your data sources, and start managing your data in a way that makes sense for your business.

At the heart of Fast Data product is a commitment to helping our customers unlock the full potential of their data. With these new plug-and-play connectors, we are proud to take another step towards achieving this goal, and we look forward to seeing the many ways our customers will use them to drive their businesses forward.

### Bucket Storage Support

Bucket Storage Support will provide users with a simple and reliable way to store and manage their data. Users can now easily store their data to a cloud storage bucket (Google and S3-like buckets are supported) and can be sure that their data is securely stored and easily accessible whenever they need it. This new feature also makes it easy to restore data wehnever is needed.

Re-ingesting data has never been easier with the Bucket Storage Support feature. Users can now easily re-ingest their data into the system, which means they can restore data previously removed with few actions.

Lastly, the Bucket Storage Support feature makes it possible to offload the projections storage. This means that users can now offload their projections relying on the data stored in this separate storage bucket, which reduces the amount of storage needed in the main system. This can lead to significant cost savings and improved system performance.

In summary, the Bucket Storage Support feature provides users with greater control over their data and makes it easier to backup, re-ingest, and manage their data.
