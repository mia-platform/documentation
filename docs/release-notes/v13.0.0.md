**Welcome to Mia-Platform v13!**

## Console

### Support to iFrame Extensions in Console 

From now on, you can embed external web pages within Mia-Platform Console using iFrames. You can therefore register, activate and manage your extensions via API directly from our API Portal. This feature can enhance your experience and improve the customization of your working space by effortlessly integrating tools, dashboards, and other external content directly into our IDP.

The supported sections of the Console where you can add such extensions are at Company and Project level, as well as the Runtime section of your Project.

### Blueprint and Template management via User Interface

We're excited to unveil a significant enhancement to our platform: Blueprint and Template management via the User Interface. This update transforms how you handle your company's Blueprint alongside their respective Templates and settings.

With our new user-friendly interface, managing your Blueprint and Templates becomes a breeze. Say goodbye to the complexity of the CMS interface and hello to streamlined setup. This new section can simplify your project processes, gain better control over them, and seamless user experience.

### Manage Sidecars in Console

From now on, you can add and manage Sidecar containers in your Microservices directly from the Design area of your Project! 

We have introduced the brand new `Sidecars` section where you can view and govern all the configurations of your Sidecars. You can also manage each of those Sidecar configurations in the detail page of each of your Microservices, in a new card dedicated to the containers management.

### Improvements

#### New Flow Manager Configurator features

From now on, the Flow Manager Configurator provides the ability to search for Flow Manager services within the project and to search for states and events of the flow currently being viewed which are selected and centered within the canvas.

#### Get user roles on all Company resources 

The API to retrieve user roles on a Company now includes in the response all the resources the user has access to based on hierarchical permissions (even without a direct binding associated with it)

#### Revision/Version info available in the payload sent by the Orchestrator Generator

From now on, also the name of the Revision/Version is included in the payload sent by the Orchestrator Generator.

## Fast Data

### Fast Data Configurator

#### Control Plane configuration card inside the Projection Storer page

A new card has been added to the Projection Storer configuration page to allow changes to the Control Plane settings.

#### Bug Fix

This version addressed the following bug:

* the `Custom` option editor on the Message Format tab has been moved into a modal to prevent unexpected focus changes while writing code
* the `Flow Manager Configurator` button in the microservices section correctly redirects to the right flow
* in the Flow Manager Configurator, the `isFinal` flag is automatically disabled when events are edited via drag and drop

Additionally, several changes and fixes have been added to the No Code Aggregation:

* mappings that contain the `__fromFile__` keyword or constant values (e.g. `__string__[]`) are no longer erased when adding a new dependency or setting a new path
* dependencies that contain the `aliasOf` keyword are now correctly handled and it is possible to map them and to set paths without seeing errors
* Single Views and CRUD collections can now be used as Base Projection options inside the Aggregation placeholder or the Single View Creator `Settings` tab
* newly selected fields for mapping are not deselected when not configured
* the warning and error icons update correctly when mapping a field
* Array of String fields are now handled inside the `Advanced mode` 
* it is now possible to correctly add new dependencies for nested fields
* an info badge now appears when a selected dependency contains `Object` or `Array` type fields, guiding the use of the `__fromFile__` keyword
* the button for selecting and deselecting fields for mapping has been renamed `Edit field list` to improve clarity
* the `Set path` modal width has been adjusted
