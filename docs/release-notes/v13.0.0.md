**Welcome to Mia-Platform v13!**

## Console

### Support to iFrame Extensions in Console 

From now on, you can embed external web pages within Mia-Platform Console using iFrames. You can therefore register, activate and manage your extensions via API directly from our API Portal. This feature can enhance your experience and improve the customization of your working space by effortlessly integrating tools, dashboards, and other external content directly into our IDP.

The supported sections of the Console where you can add such extensions are at Company and Project level, as well as the Runtime section of your Project.

To discover more about how to register and activate an iFrame extension in Console, please refer to the related [documentation page]()
