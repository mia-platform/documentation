## Console

### New Features

#### User feedback in Console

From now on, you can share feedback and propose ideas to help Product teams improve the Product experience directly in Console, without the need to change your webpage.  
You can leave precious feedback by clicking on the related Feedback icon, which is available from the Console Launchbar. 

All the collected feedback will be addressed to the Console maintenance teams, who will manage and process it within a dedicated section of the CMS.

For more details, [go to the official documentation](/development_suite/user-feedback/give-feedback.md).

## Fast Data

### Fast Data Configurator

:::danger
In this version of Fast Data Configurator we reviewed the logic that creates and manages public variables related to Fast Data. In particular, all the public
variables starting with the prefix `FAST_DATA_` are interested. Due to this refactor, when a commit is created in Console, these variables are deleted and recreated.

Unfortunately, other variables that were defined with the prefix `FAST_DATA_` and that are not managed by our configurator are erased in the saving process. For this reason,
before saving any work on the Console project using Fast Data, we recommend to rename all your variables starting with `FAST_DATA_` that are not included in following ones:

- `FAST_DATA_<real-time-updater-service-name>_INVARIANT_TOPIC_MAP`
- `FAST_DATA_<real-time-updater-service-name>_PR_UPDATES_MAP`

where `<real-time-updater-service-name>` it is the service identifier defined in the _microservices_ section, one for each defined Real-Time Updater plugin.

A hotfix is available in `v11.7.1`.
:::

#### New Features

##### Support for multiple Real-Time Updaters

It is now possible to link multiple Real-Time Updaters to a single System of Records choosing which projections are handled by which service. Moreover, Real-Time Updaters are no longer automatically created on commit, but need to be created from Marketplace and then linked manually to a System of Records.
