## Marketplace

### Marketplace Updates

* overhauled Mongo view update logic to avoid requesting [`dropCollection`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/privilege-actions/#mongodb-authaction-dropCollection) privilege action
* introduce abort controller to NodeJS stream pipeline to ensure the pipeline object is cleaned up when the response stream is destroyed

##### Fixed


* prevent a memory leak the service was experiencing when it was not able to fulfill incoming requests
