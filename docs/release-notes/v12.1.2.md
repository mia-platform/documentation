## Console

### Bug Fix

This version addresses a bug that prevents the deploy page to properly be displayed when using deployment pull strategy. Before this version release, the CI/CD Tool configuration placeholder was shown instead.

## How to update your Console

For self-hosted installations, please head to the [self hosted upgrade guide](../infrastructure/self-hosted/how-to-upgrade.md#v12---version-upgrades or contact your Mia-Platform referent and upgrade to _Console Helm Chart_ `v11.1.2`.
