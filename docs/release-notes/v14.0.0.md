## Environment centric workflow for Projects (only for Enhanced Projects) &lt;Highlight color="#e5c762">BETA&lt;/Highlight>

We've redesigned environment management in Console, significantly simplifying your Design workflow. The environment is now central, replacing branches. You'll work directly within specific environments across all Console sections, ensuring a consistent and intuitive experience.

For more information, go to the [documentation](/) and visit [Mia-Platform Console v14 Overview](/).

## Projects for Infrastructure Provisioning

We've introduced a new Project category for greater control over infrastructure provisioning in Console. Designed for Operations teams, these new type of Projects let you manage infrastructure resources directly, aligning with Infrastructure as Code. You can now easily visualize, manage, and efficiently execute provisioning actions.
Just create an Infrastructure Project and start provisioning infrastructure to your Developers!

## iframe extensions support login with Console SSO

We've enhanced iframe extensions with unified and secure authentication using Console SSO. Your extensions can now recognize user permissions and manage authentication seamlessly, ensuring only authorized users can access them and improving overall security.
