## Console

### Improvements

#### Integration of webhook payload on “Project Created”

Data regarding the template used to create the Project and other information about it has been added to the “Project Created” event payload. 

More information can be found on the [respective documentation](/console/company-configuration/events.mdx).

#### Versions details when creating a versioned Marketplace item

We have improved the experience of creating a versioned resource from the Marketplace by adding the possibility to see the detail of each version before instantiating the resource.
You only have to open the versions selector and click on the "Version details" button: a modal window will open with the details of the selected version.

### Bug Fix

This version addressed the following bugs:

* we fixed a bug that caused the Project Homepage to not show running pods even though they were present;
* we fixed a bug that caused the environments selector to disappear once you clicked on an extension at the Runtime level;
* we fixed a bug that was causing the `Tag Created` event to not include `project` data in the payload;
* we fixed a wrong behavior that prevented the user to correctly save the configuration after performing a merge of configurations.
