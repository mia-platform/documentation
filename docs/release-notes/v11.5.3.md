## Console

### Bug Fix

#### Inability to create cluster from empty-state

Fixed a bug on the empty-state button in the Clusters section that prevented the connection of the first cluster on the respective Company.

## How to update your Console

For on-premise installations, please contact your Mia-Platform referent and upgrade your _Console Helm Chart_ to `v9.5.5+hotfix.1`.
