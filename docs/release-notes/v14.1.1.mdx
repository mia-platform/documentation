## Bug fix

We resolved an issue that occurred in a specific scenario: when a ConfigMap was deleted and immediately recreated with the same name, the Console could fail to save the change correctly, causing configuration corruption.  
This configuration can then only be restored using a previous snapshot, which is possible within the [dedicated Revision History modal](/products/console/set-up-infrastructure/revisions-and-versions#revision-history.md).

## How to update your Console

For self-hosted installations, please head to the [self hosted upgrade guide](/infrastructure/self-hosted/installation-chart/100_how-to-upgrade.md) or contact your Mia-Platform referent and upgrade to _Console Helm Chart_ `v14.2.2-0`.
