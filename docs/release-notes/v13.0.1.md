## Console

### Clone configuration of a Sidecar

From the `Sidecars` section, you can now clone an existing configuration of a Sidecar to other Microservices. You can perform such action by simply clicking on the new "Add to another microservice" button available in the detail of each Sidecar and select the configuration you want to clone and the target Microservices in which to attach such Sidecar configuration. 

For more information, please refer to the [Sidecars documentation page](/console/design-your-projects/sidecars.md#clone-a-sidecar).

### Improvements

### Improved Console navigation with `ctrl/cmd + k`

The navigation with `ctrl/cmd + k` has been revised and improved for a better user experience when navigating among resources. Users can now easily see which Companies and Projects they belong to and can quickly search within these resources and seamlessly jump to them.

### Delete a Microservice in `Advanced` tab

The experience of deleting a Microservice has been revised: from now on, if you want to delete a Microservice, you need to do so within the `Advanced` tab in the Microservice detail page.

### Raw Manifest Configuration in `Advanced` tab

Configuring the raw manifest of a Microservice is now possible within the `Advanced` tab in the Microservice detail page.

### Git repository name validation accepts aldo dots

In the creation of a template or an example, you can now insert dots inside the Git Repository Name, as the validation now allows such inclusion.

### Human readable error validations in Create new branch modal & Project creation page

Error validations when trying to create a new Branch or a new Project appear now more human readable, improving clarity and user understanding.
