## Console

### New Features

Users who can add new elements to the Marketplace now have the possibility to configure by default the option "Preserve files and directories already existing in the Runtime Mount Path directory" already when creating the resource.

For more information, visit the documentation page to Add a new element to the Marketplace.

### Improvements

Inside the Authorization section, now the "Manual Routes" table clearly shows the name of the Response policy. Furthermore, if a row filter on request has been set, it is now visible with a specific icon next to the Request policy name.

### Bug Fix

This version addressed a few bugs, here is a comprehensive list:

* We fixed a bug that forced saving to another branch if you saved after performing the merge of configurations within the same branch
* A bug introduced in the Console version 10.4.0 that prevented the correct visibility of the Debug section has been fixed
