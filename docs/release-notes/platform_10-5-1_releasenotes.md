## Console

### New Features

#### imagePullSecrets configured at Company and Project level 

Custom imagePullSecrets can now be defined and configured for a specific Company and its related Projects: this means that also PaaS users can now configure custom private image registries both at Company and Project level. Each time a new Project is created, these image providers will be cloned from the Company in order to be available on the Project as well.

To discover more, take a look at the [documentation page](/development_suite/company/create.mdx#default-configuration-for-a-new-project) concerning the Default configuration for a new project.

#### New permissions to create, edit and delete a project

A new set of permissions has been added to the Super User, in order to better manage the whole lifecycle of a Project. The newly introduced permissions are:

* `console.root.project.create`: allows the Super User to create any project
* `console.root.project.details.update`: allows the Super User to edit any project
* `console.root.project.delete`: allows the Super User to delete any project 

If you want to find more info about Console levels and permission management, please visit the related [documentation page](/development_suite/console-levels-and-permission-management.md).

### Improvements

#### Mount Path preserve configuration 

Users who can add new elements to the Marketplace now have the possibility to configure the option "Preserve files and directories already existing in the Runtime Mount Path directory" already when creating the resource.

For more information, visit the [documentation page](/marketplace/add_to_marketplace/contributing_overview.md) to Add a new element to the Marketplace.

#### Response policy name in the Manual Routes table

Inside the Authorization section, now the "Manual Routes" table clearly shows the name of the Response policy. Furthermore, if a row filter on request has been set, it is now visible with a specific icon next to the Request policy name.

### Bug Fix

This version addressed a few bugs, here is a comprehensive list:

* We have solved an issue with the git `sshUrl` regex by extending the support on its validation pattern 

## Fast Data

### New Features

#### Bucket Storage Support (BSS)

We announce the release of the Bucket Storage Support New Feature! Do you need to manage data with different temperatures? You can now extend your Fast Data solution by adding the possibility to store raw data in a Bucket, re-ingest them in the system whenever needed and keep those data clean and organized. This solution requires 3 different plugins that can be found in Mia-Platform Marketplace. Check out the [official documentation](/fast_data/bucket_storage_support/overview.md).
Buckets supported: Google Cloud Buckets and S3-compatible Buckets.

#### Single View Trigger Generator

:::info
This feature is still in BETA, and it is under active development. Pay attention using this feature.
:::

We announce the release of the new Single View Trigger Generator plugin. This plugin will replace the old Single View Trigger, which has been deprecated. This new plugin is a re-engineering of the old Single View Trigger and it will let you implement a full event-driven architecture for your Fast Data. Check out the [official documentation](/fast_data/single_view_trigger_generator.md).

### Improvements

#### Real Time Updater can opt-out on the usage of `pos` property

### Bug Fix

#### Stabilized probes in the Real Time Updater

We've refactored the Real Time Updater's initialization step in version 7.4.0 to stabilize the k8 probes making them more reliable.

Fixed bug in which the Real Time Updater kept entering a state of rebalance being unable to re-join the kafka consumer group.
