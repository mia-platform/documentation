## Console

### Load a previous snapshot on Projects with the enhanced workflow

From now on, you can load a previous snapshot on Projects using the enhanced workflow. Once loaded, you can edit such configuration and save on a new revision, create a new version or exit such snapshot and return to the latest.  

If you want to load a previous snapshot, you only have to open the revision action popover, click on the `History` button and head to the clickable snapshots from the revision history modal.

### Configure environment variables from Configmap

Public variables can now also be used inside Microservices' configmap configurations. Inside the Microservice detail page you can now select or create a new configuration of type configmap.

After creating a configmap, create or select a configuration file and use public variables by including interpolated keys. Just create an object, add a field, and set the interpolated value.

For more information, visit the related [documentation page](/development_suite/api-console/api-design/public_variables.md#how-to-use-a-public-variable-in-a-configmap-configuration).

### Improvements

#### Design Overview visible to Guest role

The Design Overview section, accessible at Company level, is now visible also to users with `Guest` role.  

### Bug Fix

This version addressed the following bugs:

* Fixed a bug that caused the Design Overview data and filter to not show all the available information when there were Projects within a Company having large configuration files;
* We better addressed the warning returned to users when they have an instance of an application whose original resource has been deleted from the Marketplace;
* We fixed a misconfiguration that prevented the correct refresh of Console pages with active iFrame extensions.
