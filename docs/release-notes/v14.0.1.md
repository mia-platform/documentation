## Simplified Promotion flow

In a Environment Based Project, you can now decide to promote an environment with the Simplified mode, in order to speed up your flow.
When this mode is selected, once the Public variables have been chosen, the changes of the chosen Environment will be directly applied in the target Environment. 

<div style={{width: '400px', maxWidth: '100%', display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', borderRadius: '4px', overflow: 'hidden'}}>
