Welcome to Mia-Platform v12! This latest major release is focused on scaling Developer Experience (DevX).
Let's take a closer look to all the new features included in Mia-Platform v12.

## GitOps in Pull

Mia-Platform Console used to support just GitOps in Push approach. 
Now, we implemented also the GitOps in Pull approach, letting you decide which one to choose.
When starting a new Project, you will be able to choose which approach adopt for that project.
The GitOps in Pull approach has several benefits from a security perspective.
To learn more about this feature, take a look at the video below or read the [full documentation](#).

### Import and export between projects

It is now possible to import and export different assets from one project to another.
The assets that can be imported and exported include:

- Projections;
- Single Views;
- Configurations.

Everything is fully explained in the related [documentation](#).

### Refactored architecture

We refactored the architecture of Mia-Platform Fast Data to enable the integration of new technologies and services.
The new architecture has significantly improved overall performance.
Learn more on the [documentation](#).

## Internal Company Marketplace

With Mia-Platform v12 it is now possible to configure individual Marketplace services so that they are exclusively accessible to members of your company.

###  Marketplace management through CLI
Thanks to [Miactl (Mia-Platform CLI)](https://docs.mia-platform.eu/docs/cli/miactl/overview), it is possible to manage items in the company Marketplace without having to use the CMS.

## Microfrontend Composer (formerly BackOffice)

Mia-Platform Backoffice is now called Microfrontend Composer. You will find all the documentation updated with the new name. 
Thanks to it, you can seamlessly compose complex internal apps using both readyâ€‘to-use and custom libraries and templates.
We improved the development experience to make it as smooth and intuitive as possible by enhancing the No-Code functionality.
Microfrontend Composer still leverages the open-source tool [micro-lc](https://micro-lc.io/docs).
Take a look at the video below to see its potential, and the read the full [documentation](#) for all the information.

## A brand new navigation

We renewed the navigation of Mia-Platform Console, to make it even more developer-friendly. The design is engineered to reduce cognitive load, cut distraction points, increase focus and streamline navigation within the Mia-Platform Console.
This feature is in Preview, and you can activate it from user settings (Top-Right Profile Icon > Feature Preview > Toggle) to test it.

## Manual Launch Of CronJobs

Users with permissions can now trigger CronJobs for immediate execution directly from the Runtime area.
This is very helpful when you made some changes and the cronjob is scheduled to run on a non-working hour.

## API Gateway Listener Management

Mia-Platform Console now allows easy configuration of endpoint exposure on desired hosts, eliminating the need to manually specify it in the YAML file.
