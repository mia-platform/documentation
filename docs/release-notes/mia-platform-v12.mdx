Welcome to Mia-Platform v12! This latest major release is focused on scaling Developer Experience (DevX).
Let's take a closer look to all the new features included in Mia-Platform v12.

## GitOps in Pull

Mia-Platform Consle used to support just GitOps in Push approach. 
Now, we implemented also the GitOps in Pull approach, letting you decide which one to choose.
When starting a new Project, you will be able to choose which approach adopt for that project.
The GitOps in Pull approach has several benefits from a security perspective.
To learn more about this feature, take a look at the video below or read the [full documentation](#).

## Mia-Platform Fast Data

We further improved the No-Code functionalities of Mia-Platform Fast Data, and now you it will only takes you 1 hour to aggregate a Single View from scratch.
Below you can find a video that shows you how it works. To learn more, please refer to the [documentation](#).

### Import and export between projects

Moreover, now you can import and export several assets from one project to another.
The assets you can import and export include:

- Projections;
- Single Views;
- Configurations.

Everything is fully explained in the related [documentation](#).

### Refactored architecture

We refactored the architecture of Mia-Platform Fast Data to empower new technology integration.
Now, it will be easier to integrate with new services.
Also, the new architecture improves the overall performance.

## Marketplace

Now you can configure individual services on the Marketplace to be accessible exclusively by your company's members.
Watch the video below to learn more about how it works and refer to the [documentation](#) for further details.

Also, from now you can manage Marketplace items through CLI. 
Thanks to Miactl (Mia-Platform CLI), it will be possible to manage the company's Marketplace items without having to use the CMS.

## Microfrontend Composer

Mia-Platform Backoffice is now called Microfrontend Composer.
Thanks to it, you can seamlessly compose complex internal apps using both readyâ€‘to-use and custom libraries and templates.
We put a lot of effort in making it as much no-code as possible.
Last but not least, it is based on the open-source tool [micro-lc](https://micro-lc.io/docs).
Take a look at the video below to see its potential, and the read the full [documentation](#) for all the information.

## A brand new navigation

We renewed the navigation of Mia-Platform Console, to make it even more user-friendly.
This feature is in preview, and you can activate it from user settings to see what will change.
Below you can see a video that gives you a more detailed idea of the full navigation.

## Manual Launch Of CronJobs

Users with permissions can now trigger CronJobs for immediate execution directly from the Runtime area.
This is very helpful when you made some changes and the cronjob is scheduled to run on a non-working hour.
