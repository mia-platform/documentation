## Microfrontend Composer (formerly BackOffice)

Mia-Platform Backoffice is now called Microfrontend Composer. You will find all the documentation updated with the new name. 
Thanks to it, you can seamlessly compose complex internal apps using both ready‑to-use and custom libraries and templates.
We improved the development experience to make it as smooth and intuitive as possible by enhancing the No-Code functionality.
Microfrontend Composer still leverages the open-source tool [micro-lc](https://micro-lc.io/docs).  

Take a look at the video below to see its potential.

## Enhanced Settings Management

Inside the 'Overview' Area of a Project, the revised 'Settings' section has been enriched on new functionalities to speed-up and optimize the overall administration of Projects, which – until now – was only possible exclusively via CMS, making it no longer tedious or error-prone!

For more information, [go to the official documentation](/console/project-configuration/project-settings.md).

## Envoy API Gateway Listeners Management

In Projects using Envoy API Gateway, Mia-Platform Console allows you to easily configure endpoint exposure on the desired hosts without having to manually specify it in the YAML file.

For more information, [go to the documentation](/development_suite/api-console/api-design/listeners.md).

## User Groups Management

[IAM section](/development_suite/identity-and-access-management/index.md) has been enriched with User Groups Management.  
Thanks to groups it is possible to simplify and speed-up the management of a multitude of users who have to be assigned the same privileges.  
Users management through groups sits alongside the current individual identities access management, to allow you to better structure access to resources and fit your teams structure, giving you the freedom to choose how to govern access levels of your Company users.

For more information, [go to the documentation](/development_suite/identity-and-access-management/manage-groups.md).

## Manual Launch Of CronJobs

Launch immediate executions of CronJobs directly from the Runtime area of the Console.  
Once launched, you will see the created Job and the relative Pod in the dedicated resource sections of the Runtime area.

For more information, [go to the documentation](/development_suite/monitoring/resources/cronjobs.md#manually-launching-a-cronjob).

## Client Credentials as cluster auth for AKS

Via Mia-Platform Console, it is now possible to add Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters with client credentials authentication.
