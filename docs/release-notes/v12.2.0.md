## Data Catalog

The first version of Mia-Platform Data Catalog is available! This powerful addition to our platform is designed to have a centralized repository that stores metadata and information about the data assets that you want to collect. Its key features are:

* Metadata Collection: A service Agent is in charge of reading metadata from data sources and sending them to Mia-Platform Console. At the moment the supported Data Sources are Oracle Database (supported versions from 11 to 21), MySQL Database (supported versions from 5.7 to 8.2), Microsoft SQL Server Database (supported versions from 2017 to 2022), and PostgreSQL Database (version supported versions from 9.6 to 16).
* Centralized Metadata Management: Easily access comprehensive metadata for all your data assets. It is possible to enrich the metadata with more needed information such as data sensitivity all in one centralized location.
* Everything in one place: it is possible to seamlessly see all the data under the __Design Overview__ section of your __Company settings__. It is also possible to export such data as CSV file.

How to Get Started:

To start using the Data Catalog, simply follow the [documentation](/fast_data/data_catalog/overview.md).

## Console

### Improvements

#### Automatic commit message generation

From now, when saving configuration in Design Area, a commit message is automatically suggested. Then, user can decide to overwrite the commmit message, or proceed directly to save configuration.

#### Inheritance of Repo Visibility for Template and Example

By creating a template or example via console marketplace, the repository that will be created will inherit the one set for the respective project.

#### CLI new commands for the list of the Identities in a Project

With this version, the Mia-Platform CLI (miactl) has been integrated with new functionalities to list all identities surveyed in a Project.

In particular, the user will now be able to:
- display the list of all the identities of a specific Project;
- edit the identities of a specific Project;
- remove the role of an identity of a specific Project;

For more information, visit the [dedicated documentation](/cli/miactl/30_commands.md#iam).
