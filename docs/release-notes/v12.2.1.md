## Console

### Revision History for Projects with Enhanced Workflow

We have introduced the possibility to view the history of revisions for projects using the Enhanced Workflow.

Now, you can get a quick overview of all the saves made within a specific revision, including additional information such as the date & time, author, and the message associated with the revision save.

You can access this feature by clicking on the "History" button inside the revision action popover: a modal will show up, will all the afore-mentioned information.

#### CRUD Service

_CRUD Service_ version 6.x.x has just received the last update with version `v6.10.0`

##### New Features

- the `GET /<collection>/count` endpoint, which compute the total number of documents contained within selected collection, now accepts a new query parameter `_useEstimate` that instructs the underlying logic to retrieve an approximated count, regardless of any filter (hence `__STATE__` filter is not honored when this parameter is configured to `true`)
- the general `/-/schemas` endpoint and the collection specific `/<collection>/schema` endpoint have been added, so that it is possible to introspect the collections and obtain their data model as JSON schemas

##### Bug Fix

This version addressed a few bugs, here is a comprehensive list:

* support for querying nested fields whose type is `Date` has been fixed, so that the input type is properly converted to the stored type before performing the comparison between values

---

Furthermore, the new version `v7.0.0` of the _CRUD Service_ is available!

##### Breaking Changes

- introduce support to MongoDB `v7.0.0` and drop support for MongoDB `v4.2.0`
- to better clarify the error response, when inserting a new document in a collection and a duplicated unique key error is raised, the service now replies with a _409 Conflict_ HTTP Error, instead of _422 Unprocessable Entity_ HTTP Error
- to better clarify the error response, when requesting a document `__STATE__` to transition to an invalid value, a _400 Bad Request_ HTTP Error is returned, rather than a _404 Not Found_ HTTP Error
- querying documents with fields not specified in the collection data model now yields a _400 Bad Request_ HTTP Error to enforce data model access. Similarly, documents fields not defined in the collection data model are not returned in the response

##### New Features

- introduced `defaultSorting` as a new collection configuration property. This allows to define a set of fields with their sorting direction to be employed as sorting operation to all the GET queries whenever the `_s` parameter is not specified. In the case `_s` query parameter is set, it takes precedence over the default sorting assigned to the collection config.
By default, the property is not set, so that the default behavior with respect to previous service versions remains unchanged.

A migration guide is available [here](/runtime_suite/crud-service/guides/10_migration-guide-v7.md) to aid you in migrating your existing CRUD services to version `v7.0.0`.
