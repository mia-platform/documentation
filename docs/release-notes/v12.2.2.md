## Console

### Compare changes between a revision save and the previous one

On Projects with the Enhanced Workflow, you can now make a comparison of the changes between a saved revision and the previous one. This can be done by simply going inside the revision History section – accessible from the related icon on the revision action popover – and clicking on the button on the side of each saved revision: a diff modal will show up, highlighting the changes between the selected revision save and the previous one.
