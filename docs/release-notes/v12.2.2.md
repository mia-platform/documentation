## Fast Data

### Fast Data Configurator

#### Improvements

##### Better error handling inside Aggregation No Code for Single View key fields

The No Code Aggregation section has been revamped to display only fields that are already mapped or Single View key fields, reducing clutter and improving clarity. This is especially useful for Single Views with lots of fields in their Data Model. When needed, a new button will allow to add unmapped fields inside the section.

### Fast Data Services

#### Real-Time Updater

The new version `v7.5.8` of the _Real-Time Updater_ is available!

##### Improvements

###### Support for events compression

Starting from this version, the service can now produce events using the supported compression algorithms, that are:

- `gzip`
- `snappy`

This yields an improvement over the storage usage on the Kafka broker, since less space is necessary to store the events
generated by Fast Data service. To configure such feature, please add the new environment variable `PRODUCER_COMPRESSION`
with the necessary value.

:::info
Real-Time updater consumer already supported compression on the consumer component, so that change events sent from your System Of Record systems can be compressed too.
:::

For more information check out the service [changelog](/runtime_suite/real-time-updater/changelog.md).

#### Single View Trigger Generator

The new version `v3.1.6` of the _Single View Creator_ is available!

##### Improvements

###### Support for events compression

Starting from this version, the service can now consume and produce events using the supported compression algorithms, that are:

- `gzip`
- `snappy`

This yields an improvement over the storage usage on the Kafka broker, since less space is necessary to store the events
generated by Fast Data service. To configure such feature on the producer side, please add the `compressionName` property with needed value
to the Event Store _producer_ configuration. On the contrary, the consumer component is automatically enabled to read events that have been compressed.

##### Bug Fix

This version addressed a few bugs, here is a comprehensive list:

- fixed a runtime error that happened when the service tried to parse a projection update message  having a key field with `null` value  

For more information check out the service [changelog](/runtime_suite/single-view-trigger-generator/changelog.md).
