## Console

### Improvements

#### Added Support for the OPTIONS Verb on Endpoints' Routes

You can now add a new route using the OPTIONS verb directly from your Endpoint's detail page. 

#### More insights on production environments from the Projects table

We've enriched the Projects list to provide quick access to key production metrics. Now, by simply hovering over a tooltip near the production environment's name, you can instantly see its last deploy time, along with its current CPU and memory usage. This enhancement gives you a faster and easier way to monitor the health and status of your production environments directly from the Projects table.
