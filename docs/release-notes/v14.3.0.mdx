- **[Kango](/products/fast_data/fast_data_engine_v2/kango/10_Overview.md)** enables data product persistence from Kafka topics to MongoDB collections

Experience **up to 10x performance improvement** in aggregation operations and enables **scalable and efficient real-time Fast Data pipelines**.

## Enhanced Software Catalog Management Features

Weâ€™ve added new capabilities to improve Catalog item management and customization:

These features provide greater flexibility in organizing and enriching your Software Catalog.
