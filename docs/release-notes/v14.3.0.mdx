## Enhanced Software Catalog Management Features

Weâ€™ve added new capabilities to improve Catalog item management and customization:

- support for adding **maintainers, useful links, labels,** and **annotations** to Catalog items;
- ability to map **relationships between existing Catalog items**, as well as define relationships with **custom entities**.

These features provide greater flexibility in organizing and enriching your Software Catalog.

<!-- Please refer to the documentation for more information. -->

## Console

### Improvements

#### Added Support for the OPTIONS Verb on Endpoints' Routes

You can now add a new route using the OPTIONS verb directly from your Endpoint's detail page.

#### More insights on production environments from the Projects table

We've enriched the Projects list to provide quick access to key production metrics. Now, by simply hovering over a tooltip near the production environment's name, you can instantly see its last deploy time, along with its current CPU and memory usage. This enhancement gives you a faster and easier way to monitor the health and status of your production environments directly from the Projects table.
