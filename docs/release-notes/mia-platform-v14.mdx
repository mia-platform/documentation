## Self-service Applications

The Self-Service Application Development paradigm aims to significantly accelerate software delivery timelines. This acceleration is realized through the provision of a Software Catalog, which offers readily available, reusable components, coupled with access to a suite of composable and orchestrated technologies. The entire process operates within a framework of flexible governance, strategically designed to abstract underlying complexities and thereby permit development teams to dedicate their primary focus to the implementation of essential business logic.

### Enhancing Software Catalog and Release Management

In v14, we've significantly enhanced the Software Catalog, improving both management and precision. Key updates include comprehensive item schema reviews, ensuring all definitions are standardized, fully documented, and easily accessible to stakeholders. Addiotionally, the manifests for the public items in the Mia-Platform catalog are now publicly available [here](https://github.com/mia-platform-marketplace/public-catalog), offering greater transparency.

### Software Items Lifecycle renewed

We've also revamped the **release life cycle** with new stages like `Coming soon`,`Draft`,`Published`,`Maintenance`,`Deprecated`,`Archived`, and `Deleted`. These changes provide a more structured and adaptable framework for managing catalog items, from development to retirement, making the process more efficient and reliable.

### Headless Catalog

Furthermore, the marketplace APIs have been optimized and are now officially published on the API portal, ensuring easy access for all users.

## Real time data integration

The Real-Time Data Integration capability is focusing on streamlining data collection processes from various sources, automatically enriching datasets with pertinent metadata for improved context and usability, and establishing governed mechanisms for controlled data access. This suite facilitates real-time decoupling between systems by enabling asynchronous data exchange, thereby providing the continuous, low-latency data flows necessary to fuel the core platform operations and power associated Artificial Intelligence functions.

### Data Lineage

Mia-Platform Data Catalog introduces **Data Lineage**, a powerful tool for understanding, visualizing, and describing the flow and transformations of data within an organization.  
This feature allows users to explore data relationships at two complementary levels: **Table Lineage** and **System of Record (SoR) Lineage**, providing both granular insights and a holistic overview of data flows.  
By offering a detailed visualization of data dependencies and relationships, the **Lineage** view enables users to perform impact analyses, identify potential bottlenecks, and ensure compliance across data workflows.  
Users can enrich the **Lineage** with **virtual assets** and **jobs**, allowing them to complete relationships not yet automatically retrieved and to clearly describe the context and purpose of each data flow.  
If you're using **Fast Data Control Plane**, aggregation processes configured within your **Fast Data Projects** are automatically captured, making **Fast Data jobs** directly visible on the **Lineage** canvas.

To find out how it works and all the benefits of our Data Lineage solution, please refer to the related [documentation](/data_catalog/frontend/data_lineage.mdx).

### Integration Connector Agent

The **Integration Connector Agent** is a modular plugin designed to enable seamless **data integration** between external **sources** and **sinks**.  
It collects data from external systems, processes and normalizes it, and then sends the data to a defined sink. The Agent supports multiple sources, including **webhooks** from services such as **Mia-Platform Console** and **Jira**, and integrates with **MongoDB** as the current supported sink.  
Thanks to its pluggable architecture, it allows easy integration of new sources and sinks with minimal configuration effort.  

By automating data flows and ensuring consistency across platforms, the Integration Connector Agent centralizes data storage, enabling the collection of information from multiple sources and its storage in the target destination. It also facilitates **data synchronization and transformation**, improving data accessibility, streamlining workflows, and supporting more effective reporting and decision-making across systems.

To learn more about all the features and how to configure it, visit the [official documentation](/runtime_suite/integration-connector-agent/10_overview.md).

### New Flow Manager Configurator layout

The Flow Manager Configurator layout has been redesigned to provide enhanced control and visibility. Users can now easily view and manage flows, add external executors, and track commands, events, and state transitions, improving the efficiency and flexibility of self-service application management.
