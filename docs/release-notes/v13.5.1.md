## New Flow Manager Configurator Layout

With this release, we are introducing the new layout for the Flow Manager Configurator. By switching to the new layout, you will be able to view and manage the flow in greater detail. This includes the ability to see and add external executors involved in the flow, as well as view commands, events, and state transitions.

Please note that the switch to the new layout is irreversible.

For more details, please refer to [documentation](/development_suite/api-console/api-design/flow-manager-configurator/how-it-works.md).

## Support for custom port and HTTP/2 protocol in Endpoints Configuration

From now on, you can create your Endpoints including also the port of the service to connect to, and enable the _Downstream Protocol_, fully supporting HTTP/2 protocol.
In this way, you can have more control on communication with your Microservices, and supporting gRPC communication.

For more details, refer to the related [documentation](/development_suite/api-console/api-design/endpoints.md).

## Console 

### Improvements

#### Service Accounts detail page

From now on you can access the detail of a Service Account by clicking on its name from the table of the related section at Company level. 

### Bug Fix

This version addressed the following bugs:

* fixed an issue where the use of underscores in the Environment ID prevented namespace creation;
* fixed an issue where malformed YAML in Infrastructure Resources resulted in unclear validation errors.

## Fast Data

### Fast Data Services

#### Projection Storer

The new version `v1.3.5` of the _Projection Storer_ is available!

#### Bug Fix

This version addressed a few bugs, here is a comprehensive list:

* after the introduction of SSL custom configuration in v1.3.2, it was assumed that SSL was disabled
when the ssl.enabled property was not specified. This prevents the service from connecting to database instances where SSL is active without configuring ssl.enabled to true. This release ensures that the SSL configuration is not enforced to false when not provided by the user, aligning the behavior of the service with that prior to v1.3.2.

For more information check out the service [changelog](/runtime_suite/projection-storer/changelog.md).
