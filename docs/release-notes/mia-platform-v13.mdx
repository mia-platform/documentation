**Welcome to Mia-Platform v13!**

# Compose your Platform
With our latest release, we empower you to "Compose your Platform", offering the freedom to compose your platform just the way you envision it. Whether you're forging new paths or refining existing strategies, Mia-Platform v13 is here to support you every step of the way, giving you the flexibility and control you need to craft a solution that fits you.
Let's take a closer look at all the new features included in Mia-Platform v13.

## Platforge: Enhance Extensibility

In today's fast-paced tech landscape, adaptability is key. That's why Mia-Platform v13 takes extensibility to the next level, making it easier than ever to integrate third-party tools and custom functionalities into your platform. We welcome **Platforge**, our brand new Extensibility toolkit, in the Mia-Platform eco-system!
The main benefits for the user can be summarized by the following:

- Extend developer lifecycle to be aligned with the needs of each team (Extend supported runtime, extend dev workflow, extend application managementâ€¦).
- Users that already use some specific tools can standardize and simplify their developer workflow, integrating them into Mia-Platform Console.

Let's go in deep with the new Features!

### Extend Frontend of Mia-Platform Console with iFrames

Extend the Console as you like.

From now on, you can seamlessly integrate external web pages within Mia-Platform Console using iFrames. 

This empowers Console Users to enrich their experience by effortlessly incorporating tools, dashboards, or external content in our IDP, streamlining development workflows and tailoring the product to suit the business.  
This function is now only accessible via Application Programming Interface (API), so it is possible to use the Mia-Platform API portal to integrate the iFrame into different sections of Mia-Platform Console. In future releases, we aim to simplify the integration of iFrame by providing directly a UI.
