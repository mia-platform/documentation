**Welcome to Mia-Platform v13!**

# Compose your Platform
With our latest release, we empower you to "Compose your Platform", offering the freedom to craft it just the way you envision it. Whether you're forging new paths or refining existing strategies, Mia-Platform v13 is here to support you every step of the way, giving you the flexibility and control you need to find a solution that fits you.
Let's take a closer look at all the new features included in Mia-Platform v13!

## Platforge: Enhance Extensibility

In today's fast-paced tech landscape, adaptability is key. That's why Mia-Platform v13 takes extensibility to the next level, making it easier than ever to integrate third-party tools and custom functionalities into your platform.
We welcome **Platforge**, our brand new Extensibility toolkit, to the Mia-Platform eco-system!
The main benefits for the user can be summarized by the following:

- Extend development lifecycle to be aligned with the needs of each team (Extend supported runtimes, dev workflows, application management, etc.).
- Users that already use some specific tools can standardize and simplify their developer workflow, integrating them into Mia-Platform Console.

Let's go in deep with the new Features:

### Extend Frontend of Mia-Platform Console with iFrames

Extend the Console as you like.

From now on, you can seamlessly integrate external web pages within Mia-Platform Console using iFrames.

This empowers Console Users to enrich their experience by effortlessly incorporating tools, dashboards, or external content in our IDP, streamlining development workflows and tailoring the product to suit the business.
This function is now only accessible via Application Programming Interface (API), so it is possible to use the Mia-Platform API portal to integrate the iFrame into different sections of Mia-Platform Console. In future releases, we aim to simplify the integration of iFrame by providing directly a UI.

### Managing Custom Resources through the Console

You can now manage and configure custom objects that are not part of the standard Console supported resources using the classic user interface of the Console. This feature further expands the Console domain over user's entire workloads, enabling greater operability, governance, and control over systems.

### React to Console actions using Webhooks

The variety of Console events suitable for webhook configuration constantly increases, allowing you to react and build custom flows and logic each time the event occurs.

With the introduction of user management events and the introduction of the history of each webhook to facilitate monitoring and debugging, users can now use webhooks to extend Console functionality.

Set up our Data Catalog Agent, to connect to different external sources, such as Oracle Database, Salesforce, Postgres Database, MySQL Database, Microsoft SQL Server Database, and to extract all metadata existing on your organization's System of Records.

Through Mia-Platform Console, it is possible to:

### Seamless Runtime Management with Fast Data Control Plane

Mia-Platform Fast Data has been empowered with a Runtime Management solution, the **Fast Data Control Plane**.

This Fast Data suite component provides a general overview of the Fast Data pipelines released on the runtime environment, and allows to monitor and govern the execution of your Fast Data system.
From its user-friendly web interface, you can pause and resume the consumption of data streams along Fast Data pipelines with just a few clicks to strategically allocate resources consumption and efficiently utilize them during peak demand processes.
Many are the benefits of adopting the Fast Data control plane in your Fast Data Projects, for example:

- **Optimize Resource Allocation**, by strategically pausing and resuming the consumption of data streams along the Fast Data pipelines
- **[Initial Load and Full Refresh processes management](/fast_data/concepts/data_loading.mdx)**, thanks to a user-friendly interface and without altering the configuration of your workloads deployed in runtime
- **Performance Testing and Simulation**, to simulate different scenarios for performance testing by observing your system behavior under various conditions
- **Enhanced System Reliability**, allowing you to gracefully handle unexpected situations and/or system maintenance periods while minimizing system downtime.
