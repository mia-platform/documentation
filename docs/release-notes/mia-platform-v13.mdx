**Welcome to Mia-Platform v13!**

# Compose your Platform
With our latest release, we empower you to "Compose your Platform", offering the freedom to craft it just the way you envision it. Whether you're forging new paths or refining existing strategies, Mia-Platform v13 is here to support you every step of the way, giving you the flexibility and control you need to find a solution that fits you.
Let's take a closer look at all the new features included in Mia-Platform v13!

## Platforge: Enhance Extensibility

In today's fast-paced tech landscape, adaptability is key. That's why Mia-Platform v13 takes extensibility to the next level, making it easier than ever to integrate third-party tools and custom functionalities into your platform.
We welcome **Platforge**, our brand new Extensibility toolkit, to the Mia-Platform eco-system!
The main benefits for the user can be summarized by the following:

- Extend development lifecycle to be aligned with the needs of each team (Extend supported runtimes, dev workflows, application management, etc.).
- Users that already use some specific tools can standardize and simplify their developer workflow, integrating them into Mia-Platform Console.

Let's go in deep with the new Features:

### Extend Mia-Platform Console using... the Console! | <Highlight color="#1890FF">v13 - Fall Release</Highlight>

We have strengthened our Platforge Extensibility Kit by adding the possibility to add extensions from Console UI and enriching the type of supported extensions. You can now extend your Console by embedding iFrames, adding External Links & composing your pages with Microfrontend Composer within a dedicated "Extensions" section, accessible to Company Owners within the Platforge section at Company level.

Customizing your Mia-Platform Console has never been so easy: simply select the type of extension, the desired Area and where to display it from the available options, then choose what you want to show your users!

To discover more about how to manage your Extensions and the types of supported extensions, head to the [Extensions documentation](/console/company-configuration/extensions.md).

### Extend Frontend of Mia-Platform Console with iFrames

Extend the Console as you like.

From now on, you can seamlessly integrate external web pages within Mia-Platform Console using iFrames.

This empowers Console Users to enrich their experience by effortlessly incorporating tools, dashboards, or external content in our IDP, streamlining development workflows and tailoring the product to suit the business.
This function is now only accessible via Application Programming Interface (API), so it is possible to use the Mia-Platform API portal to integrate the iFrame into different sections of Mia-Platform Console. In future releases, we aim to simplify the integration of iFrame by providing directly a UI.

To learn more, please refer to the [documentation](/console/console-extensibility/overview.md).

### React to Console actions using Webhooks

The variety of Console events suitable for webhook configuration constantly increases, allowing you to react and build custom flows and logic each time the event occurs.

With the introduction of user management events and the introduction of the history of each webhook to facilitate monitoring and debugging, users can now use webhooks to extend Console functionality.

![Webhook History](img/event-history.png)

To learn more, please refer to the [documentation](/console/company-configuration/webhooks.md#event-history).

### Connect Backstage portal to Mia-Platform

With Mia-Platform Backstage Plugin is possible to kickstart your Backstage App worry-free, starting from the components already on your Mia-Platform Console.
It keeps your information synchronized effortlessly and gains insights into your Company's domains, Projects, deployment environments, and repository links, all while exploring their interrelations.

You can find the brand new plugin in the [Backstage Marketplace](https://backstage.io/plugins/) looking for Mia-Platform Sync!

## Infrastructure Management

### Manage Infrastructure Resources through Console 

You can now manage and configure custom objects that are not part of the standard Console supported resources using the classic user interface of the Console. This feature further expands the Console domain over user's entire workloads, enabling greater operability, governance, and control over systems.

![Custom Resources](img/infrastructure-resources.png)

#### Support to all Infrastructure Resources | <Highlight color="#1890FF">v13 - Fall Release</Highlight>

With the Fall release updates we have officially introduced the possibility to manage the provisioning of your infrastructure, configuring - at the Design level - your Infrastructure Resources.  
Within the Design of your Console you can then see a new "Infrastructure" section entirely dedicated to Infrastructure as Code!

#### Support of Custom Kubernetes Resources in Runtime area | <Highlight color="#1890FF">v13 - Fall Release</Highlight>

We finalized the support for Kubernetes type Resources by introducing the possibility of monitoring such resources at Runtime once deployed.  
For each resource you will be able to access its detail where you will see the respective Describe and Events that are generated, similarly to the other resources in the Runtime Area.

To discover more, you can refer to the [documentation](/console/design-your-projects/custom-resources/custom-resources.md).

## Simplify Composability

Mia-Platform Suite empowers development teams to enhance software composability by facilitating streamlined reuse and embracing scalable approaches. With Mia-Platform v13, software composability is even more NoCode!
