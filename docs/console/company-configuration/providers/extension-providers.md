The Extension API Provider can be used to extend or replace some Console features.
Extensions work by telling the Console to call a remote API to perform a specific task, that would, otherwise, be completed independently.

To enable an Extension, you should connect a Provider of type **Extension API** to the desired Company, following the steps described in the [Management page](/console/company-configuration/providers/configure-provider.mdx).
