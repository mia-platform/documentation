Providers can be generically defined as connection information to use and manage external services using the Console.

The Mia-Platform Console supports providers with 3 different capabilities:

* **Git Providers**: allow users to manage repositories within their workspace;
* **Secret Managers**: allow users to securely store API keys, passwords, certificates, and other sensitive data;
* **CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery) Tools**: allow users to automate one or more stages of the so-called CI/CD pipelines (which usually consist of commit, build, test, and deploy).

The supported version of the services are present in [this table](/infrastructure/self-hosted/self-hosted-requirements.md#software-and-hardware-prerequisites).
