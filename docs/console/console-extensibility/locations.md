# Available Extension Locations

The Console allows you to embed extensions at specific locations that already contain menu items and groups, which can also be used by our extensions. These locations are:

- **Tenant** with locationId `tenant`
- **Project** with locationId `project`
- **Runtime** with locationId `runtime`

Each location has already menu groups that can be used as `category` route to which attach new menu item with your extension. 

## Tenant

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center'}}>
  <div style={{display: 'flex', width: '500px'}}> 

![tenant location](img/tenantLocation.png)
  
  </div>
</div>

This location is found on sections related to the Company on the URLs with prefix `/tenants/:tenantId` that represent the location path. As visible from the image, the sidebar already contains menu groups that can be used via parentId:

- **GENERAL GROUP** (parentId: `general`)
- **INFRASTRUCTURE GROUP** (parentId: `infrastructure`)

- **ACCESS MANAGEMENT GROUP** (parentId: `access-management`)
- **ADMINISTRATION GROUP** (parentId: `administration`)

## Runtime

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center'}}>
  <div style={{display: 'flex', width: '500px'}}> 

![runtime location](img/runtimeLocation.png)
  
  </div>
</div>

This location is found on the Runtime section of a Project on the URLs with prefix `/projects/:projectId/monitoring/environments/:envId` that represent the location path. As visible from the image, the sidebar already contains menu groups that can be used via parentId:

- **WORKLOADS GROUP** (parentId: `workloads`)

:::warning
Extensions routes placed in a specific location are visible only if the extension is activated in a context that includes that location. For this reason, an extension activated on the Project context cannot be seen if its routes are located on the `Tenant` location.
