In Mia-Platform, a "Project" is not merely a collection of microservices. Instead, it's a structured aggregation of microservices, configurations, and data. This grouping might represent an entire digital ecosystem or just a specific component within it.  
  
Within the platform's hierarchy, a "Project" sits beneath a "Company", allowing a single business entity to have an overarching view and manage multiple projects simultaneously. Such an arrangement provides organizations with unique flexibility, facilitating the adaptation and scalability of their projects based on specific operational and strategic needs.

## Project types

There are two different Project types, supported in Console:

- [Application Projects](/console/project-configuration/application-project.md): meant for software products development and release
- [Infrastructure Projects](/console/project-configuration/infrastructure-project.md): meant for operations teams, leveraging IaC for infrastructure provisioning
