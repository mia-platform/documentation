This Handbook helps you with some useful tips on how to configure Traefik in order to enable features on your Console projects.

:::note
You will find this Handbook useful only if your infrastructure includes Traefik as Ingress, that is for example the case of Console offered as PaaS.

## Add Basic Authorization

:::caution
This feature must not be used in production environments.

The basic auth must be always replaced with safer authentication methods also in other environments.
:::

To add basic authentication on some host there are few steps to follow:

### Create the Middleware
First of all you need to create a new Middleware. This is a `yaml` configuration.

Based on the Console configuration there are two options where to put the new file:
1. `configuration/{{ENV}}/`
2. `overlays/{{ENV}}/` in case of Kustomize Configuration

The file can be named as desired, in this example we will refer it as `default.basicauth.yml`

```yaml
apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1
kind: Middleware
metadata:
  name: default-basicauth
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: "ingress-controller"
spec:
  basicAuth:
    secret: authsecret
```

### Create a new secret

Create a new secret with the basic auth credentials. The [Traefik documentation](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/middlewares/http/basicauth/#general) suggest to use the `htpasswd` command to evaluate the secret.

Example with username and password:
```
echo $(htpasswd -nb username password)
```

The output of the above command is the value of the secret to create.

The secret needs to be created in the [Environments Variable section](/console/project-configuration/manage-environment-variables/index.md#add-an-environment).
In this hands-on we will refer to the secret as `BASIC_AUTH_USERS`.

#### Generate the secret with mlp
We also need to edit the [mlp](/runtime_suite_tools/mlp/40_generate.md) configuration to interpolate the secret created in the previous section.

In the `mlp.yml` file add this configuration:
```yaml
  - name: "authsecret"
    when: "always"
    data:
      - key: "users"
        value: "{{BASIC_AUTH_USERS}}"
        from: literal
```

### Add the Middleware to the Ingress
The last step is to introduce the Middleware in the IngressRoute configuration. The config can be found inside:
- `configuration/{{env}}/default.ingressroute.yml`, or
- `overlays/{{ENV}}/default.ingressroute.yml`

Add the middleware `default-basicauth` in the host where you want to setup the basic auth.
Example:
```
routes:
    - match: Host(`my-hostname.eu`)
      middlewares:
        ...
        - name: "default-basicauth"
```

With this step you finished the setup of the basic authorization.
