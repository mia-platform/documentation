# Configuration files

The Real-Time Updater has a variety of configurations: some of them are automatically managed by the MIA Console, while others can be configured by the user either using Config Maps or No-Code features.

## Message Adapters

In the Fast Data architecture CDC, iPaaS, APIs and sFTP publish messages on Kafka topic to capture change events. However, these messages could be written in different formats.
The purpose of the Kafka adapter is allowing the correct reading of these messages in order to be properly consumed by the Real-Time Updater.

Since one or multiple Real-Time Updater services could be connected to a System of Record, when creating a new System you will be asked to select the type of message adapter you want to use, 
between one of the following options (further details in the paragraphs below):
- `DB2`, based on the [IBM InfoSphere Data Replication for DB2](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2-for-zos/13?topic=getting-started-db2-zos) type CDC;
- `Golden Gate`, based on the [Oracle GoldenGate](https://docs.oracle.com/goldengate/c1230/gg-winux/GGCON/introduction-oracle-goldengate.htm#GGCON-GUID-EF513E68-4237-4CB3-98B3-2E203A68CBD4) type CDC;
- `Debezium`, based on the [Debezium](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/2.1/tutorial.html) type CDC;
- `Custom`, in case you need a completely customized message adapter (you'll be requested to write the implementation code); 

The selection will be applied to every Real-Time Updater service attached (or to any service that will be attached in the future) to ensure that those service will be expecting messages in the correct type.

In case you need to change the type of adapter to use in the Real-Time Updater, you can easily do that from the System of Record page in the _Projection_ section of the console: after selecting your System, click on the _Message Format_ tab, then select the adapter type you want to use.

### IBM InfoSphere Data Replication for DB2

It's the default one, it is based on the [IBM InfoSphere Data Replication engine](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/idr/11.4.0?topic=console-overview-cdc-replication).

The message should include the following properties:
- `timestamp`: a stringified integer greater than zero. This integer has to be a valid timestamp.
- `key`: it has to be a stringified object containing the primary key of the projection, if `value` also contains the primary key of the projection this field can be an empty string.
- `value`: it is **null** if it's a *delete* operation, otherwise it contains the data of the projection.
- `offset`: it is the offset of the Kafka message.

:::info
It is important to note that whenever the ingestion message is not a *delete* operation the `value` of the message must contain all the fields of the projection, including the primary keys also present in the `key`, so the Real-Time Updater can process the message properly.
:::

These are the only fields needed to configure correctly the message adapter. For more details and further explanations, you can read the [documentation page about the supported JSON format](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/idr/11.4.0?topic=kcop-write-json-format-records).

To see the message's structure specification and some examples go to the [Inputs and Outputs page](/fast_data/concepts/inputs_and_outputs.md#ibm-infosphere-data-replication-for-db2) .

:::caution
This Kafka message format does not support a Primary Key update. For additional information, please check the [Primary Key update](#primary-key-update) section.
:::

### Oracle GoldenGate

This Kafka Message Adapter has been created to have a format supported by [Oracle Golden Gate](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/goldengate/big-data/21.1/gadbd/using-kafka-connect-handler.html#GUID-81730248-AC12-438E-AF82-48C7002178EC). 

In this Golden Gate adapter, we expect that the message includes data as explained in the [JSON Formatter page of the official documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/goldengate/bd1221/gg-bd/GADBD/GUID-F0FA2781-0802-4530-B1F0-5E102B982EC0.htm#GADBD501).

To see the message's structure specification and some examples go to the [Inputs and Outputs page](/fast_data/concepts/inputs_and_outputs.md#oracle-goldengate) .

### Debezium

The Debezium kafka message adapter is meant to accept Debezium generated kafka messages with the following properties:

- **before**: optional value that indicates the data values before the operation execution
- **after**: optional value that indicates the data values after the operation execution
- **op**: optional value that indicates the type of operation, `c` for create/insert, `u` for update and `d` for delete

These are the main properties used by the adapter and the Real-Time Updater but you can have other properties like `ts_ms` or `source` depending on which DB is Debezium working with.

Debezium has also some "special" events which are handled in their own way:
- **Snapshot**: Snapshot events are messages that indicate the state of the DB up until that point in time. This messages are sent when the connector does not find any offsets from where to start processing, therefore they are handled as normal insert messages.
- **Tombstone**: Tombstone events are messages sent after a normal delete message and are only useful for kafka itself and its topic compression policies. For this reason the adapter will ignore and skip them.
- **Truncate**: Truncate events are messages sent when an entire table is emptied. Unfortunately we **do not support** this kind of messages at the moment and they will be skipped.

To see the message's structure specification and some examples go to the [Inputs and Outputs page](/fast_data/concepts/inputs_and_outputs.md#debezium) .

### Custom

If you have Kafka Messages that do not match one of the formats above, you can create your own custom adapter for the messages. 

To make this work, you need to create a `Custom Kafka Message Adapter` inside _Real-Time Updater_ section of the related System of Record. The adapter must be a javascript function that converts Kafka messages as received from the Real-Time Updater to an object with a specific structure. This function must receives as arguments the Kafka message and the list of primary keys of the projection, and must return an object with the following properties:

- **offset**: the offset of the Kafka message
- **timestampDate**: an instance of `Date` of the timestamp of the Kafka message.
- **keyObject**: an object containing the primary keys of the projection. It is used to know which projection document needs to be updated with the changes set in the value.
- **value**: the data values of the projection, or null
- **operation**: optional value that indicates the type of operation (either `I` for insert, `U` for update, or `D` for delete). It is not needed if you are using an upsert on insert logic (the default one), while it is required if you want to differentiate between insert and update messages.
- **before**: optional value that indicates the data values before the operation execution
- **after**: optional value that indicates the data values after the operation execution
- **operationPosition**: optional value that indicates a positive integer, usually a timestamp, which ensures messages are processed in the correct order

If the `value` is null, it is a delete operation.
The `keyObject` **cannot** be null.

To see the message's structure specification and some examples go to the [Inputs and Outputs page](/fast_data/concepts/inputs_and_outputs.md#custom) .

:::note
To support a Primary Key update, the `before`, `after` and `operationPosition` fields should be included in the adapter. (Hint: if not present, a simple `operationPosition` value might be the Kafka message timestamp).
:::

Inside configmap folder create your javascript file named `kafkaMessageAdapter.js`.

The file should export a simple function with the following signature:

```js
module.exports = function messageAdapter(message, primaryKeys, logger) {
  const {
    value: valueAsBuffer, // type Buffer
    key: keyAsBuffer, // type Buffer
    timestamp: timestampAsString, // type string
    offset: offsetAsString, // type string
  } = message

  // your adapting logic

  return {
    keyObject: keyToReturn, // type object (NOT nullable)
    value: valueToReturn, // type object (null or object)
    timestampDate: new Date(parseInt(timestampAsString)), // type Date
    offset: parseInt(offsetAsString), // type number
    operation: operationToReturn, // type string (either I, U, or D)
  }
}
```

The `message` argument is the Kafka message as received from the `real-time-updater`.  
The fields `value` and `key` are of type *Buffer*, `offset` and `timestamp` are of type *string*.

The `primaryKeys` is an array of strings which are the primary keys of the projection whose topic is linked.

:::tip
Starting from `v7.8.0`, the Real-Time Updater can accept a message adapter written as a [default ESM module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#default_exports_versus_named_exports).

```js title=esmMessageAdapter.js
export default function myEsmMessageAdapter(message, primaryKeys, logger) {
  // ...adapter logic
}
```

This definition is also supported by versions `v6.1.0` and `v.5.5.0`.

## Kafka Projection Updates Configuration

Whenever the Real-Time Updater performs a change on Mongo on a projection, you can choose to send a message to a Kafka topic as well, containing information about the performed change and, if possible, the state of the projection *before* and *after* the change and the document ID of the document involved in the change.

:::info
This feature has been introduced since version v3.5.0 of the Real-Time updater
:::

To activate this feature you need to set the following environment variables:
- `KAFKA_PROJECTION_UPDATES_FOLDER`: path to the folder that contains the file `kafkaProjectionUpdates.json`, containing configurations of the topic where to send the updates to, mapped to each projection.
- `GENERATE_KAFKA_PROJECTION_UPDATES`: defines whether the Real-Time Updater should send a message of update every time it writes the projection to Mongo. Default is `false`

:::info
From `v10.2.0` of Mia-Platform Console, a configuration for Kafka Projection Updates is automatically generated when creating a new Real-Time Updater and saving the configuration. Further information about the automatic generation can be found inside the [Projection page](/fast_data/configuration/projections.md#pr-update-topic). If you prefer to create a custom configuration, please use the following guide.
:::

You need to create a configuration with the same path as the one you set in `KAFKA_PROJECTION_UPDATES_FOLDER`. Then, you have to create a configuration file `kafkaProjectionUpdates.json` inside that configuration.

:::caution
To prevent possible conflicts with the automatically created configuration, please set the `KAFKA_PROJECTION_UPDATES_FOLDER` to a value different from the default `/home/node/app/kafkaProjectionUpdates` path.
:::

To know more on how to configure the `kafkaProjectionUpdates.json` please refer to its [Configuration](/fast_data/configuration/config_maps/kafka_projection_updates.mdx) page.

:::info
Notice that you can either set the topics for all the projections, or for a subset of them.
So, for example, if you need to setup a [Single View Patch](#single-view-patch) operation, you may want to configure only the projections needed in such Single View.
:::

## ER schema configuration

The ER Schema, defined with a `erSchema.json` file, defines the relationship between tables and projections. [On the dedicated page in the Config Map section](/fast_data/configuration/config_maps/erSchema.md), you can find a deep explanation of how ER Schema configuration works.

You can update the ER Schema in the page of the Real-Time Updater, in the _ConfigMaps & Secrets_ page. 

:::info
The ER Schema ConfigMap is created after the service is attached to a System of Record for the first time. It will include base `erSchema.json` file is generated with the following content:
```json
{ 
  "version": "1.0.0", 
  "config": { } 
}
```

This is an empty configuration: the Real-Time Updater Microservice could be deployed without pod restart, but this file must be modified according to the projections associated with this microservice to work properly.
:::  

:::tip Shared ER Schema

If you have already [attached an ER Schema to a Single View Creator](/fast_data/configuration/single_view_creator/plugin.md#selecting-an-er-schema-with-the-no-code), you can re-use it in the Real-Time Updater configuration too.

By deleting the default one and [add an existing ER Schema Config Map](/development_suite/api-console/api-design/services.md#shared-configmaps) with a mount path as the one provided in the `ER_SCHEMA_FOLDER` environment variable, changes made to an Er Schema will be reflected also in the Real-Time Updater. 

While this solution provides reusability of other ER Schemas, **[is strongly suggested to use the No Code](/fast_data/configuration/config_maps/erSchema.md#use-the-no-code)**. 
:::

## Projection Changes Schema

The `projectionChangesSchema.json` config map defines the paths for the strategy to generate the projection changes identifier. Differently from the Manual Configuration, the projection changes configurations are described with a JSON file aimed to reduce the developing effort.

:::caution
The Projection Changes Schema ConfigMap is created after the service is attached to a System of Record for the first time. 
It will include base `projectionChangesSchema.json` file is generated with the following content:
```json
{ 
  "version": "1.0.0", 
  "config": { } 
}
```

This is an empty configuration: the Real-Time Updater Microservice could be deployed without pod restart, but this file must be modified according to the projections associated with this microservice to work properly.
:::

For more information please refer to the [Projection Changes Schema](/fast_data/configuration/config_maps/projection_changes_schema.md) dedicated page.

### CAST_FUNCTION configurations

The mount path used for these configurations is: `/home/node/app/configurations/castFunctionsFolder`.  

In this folder you have all the generated [Cast Functions](/fast_data/configuration/cast_functions.md) definitions. This configuration is read-only since you can configure it from its dedicated section of the Console.

:::tip
Starting from `v7.8.0`, the Real-Time Updater can accept a cast function having [the new signature](/fast_data/configuration/cast_functions.md#new-signature), which accepts the whole ingestion message as first parameter and it's defined as a [default ESM module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#default_exports_versus_named_exports).

```js title=newCastFunction.js
export default function myNewCastFunction(messageObject, fieldName, logger) {
  return messageObject[fieldName];
}
```

This definition is also supported by versions `v6.1.0` and `v.5.5.0`.
:::

### MAP_TABLE configurations

The mount path used for these configurations is: `/home/node/app/configurations/mapTableFolder`.  

Two mappings will be placed in this folder:

* one between cast functions and fields;
* one between strategies and projections.

This configuration is read-only since it's configured automatically based on the projections of the System of Record included in the attached service and the strategies you configure from the Single Views section of the Console.

## Send Projection Changes to Kafka

:::caution
This feature is **deprecated** and will be removed in future versions of the Real-Time Updater service. In case you need the service to send events to Kafka, follow the configuration of [Kafka Projection Updates](#kafka-projection-updates-configuration).
:::

Projection changes are saved on Mongo, but from version v3.4.0 and above, you can send them to Kafka as well.

This feature enables you to send the projection changes to a topic Kafka you want to. This is useful if you want to have a history of the projection changes thanks to the Kafka retention of messages.
You can also make your own custom logic when a projection change occurs by setting a Kafka consumer attached to the topic Kafka you set.

To do that, you need to set two environment variables:

- `GENERATE_KAFKA_PROJECTION_CHANGES`: defines whether the projection changes have to be sent to Kafka too or not. Default is `false`(v3.4.0 or above).
- `KAFKA_PROJECTION_CHANGES_FOLDER`: path where has been mounted the `kafkaProjectionChanges.json` configuration (v3.4.0 or above).

You have to create a *configuration* with the same path as the one defined by the environment variable `KAFKA_PROJECTION_CHANGES_FOLDER`.
Then, you have to create a configuration file `kafkaProjectionChanges.json` inside that configuration. The configuration is a json file like the following one:

```json
{
    "MY_PROJECTION": {
        "projectionChanges": {
            "MY_SINGLE_VIEW": {
                "strategy": "MY_STRATEGY", 
                "topic": "MY_TOPIC",
            }
        }
    }
}
```

where:

- `MY_PROJECTION` is the name of the collection whose topic has received the message from the CDC.
- `MY_SINGLE_VIEW` is the single view that have to be updated
- `MY_STRATEGY` is the strategy to be used to get the identifier of the Single View to update. It could be the name of a file or, in case an automatic strategy, the string `__automatic__`.
- `MY_TOPIC` is the topic where the projection change need to be sent (for further information about the naming convention adopted for this topic, [click here](/fast_data/concepts/inputs_and_outputs.md#topic-for-svc-trigger))

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>
<p>

```json
{
    "registry-json": {
        "projectionChanges": {
            "sv_pointofsale": {
                "strategy": "__automatic__",
                "topic": "my-tenant.development.my-database.sv-pointofsale.projection-change",
            }
        }
    },
    "another-projection": {
        "projectionChanges": {
            "sv_customer": {
                "strategy": "__fromFile__[myStrategy]",
                "topic": "my-tenant.development.my-database.sv-customer.projection-change"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

When a message about `registry-json` happens, the projection changes will be saved on MongoDB, and it will be sent to the Kafka topic `my-tenant.development.my-database.sv-pointofsale.projection-change` as well.

</p>
