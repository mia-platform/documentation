# Single View Creator

The Single View Creator is the service that keeps the Single View updated with data retrieved from Projections. 
This service is available as a plugin or as a template:
- [plugin](/fast_data/configuration/single_view_creator/plugin.md): it allows you to use the Single View Creator as a black-box. You just need to configure it through the Config Maps and environment variables
- [template](/fast_data/configuration/single_view_creator/template.md): it gives you access to the source code of the Single View Creator, which will be hosted on a Git repository. You will need to update its dependencies and maintain the code. 

:::tip
We strongly recommend using the plugin. The template is supposed to be used only for advanced use cases where the plugin cannot be used.

:::note

Setting up both the variable `CONTROL_PLANE_ACTIONS_TOPIC` and `CONTROL_PLANE_KAFKA_GROUP_ID` enables the communication between the Single View Creator and the [Runtime Management](/fast_data/runtime_management.mdx).
This means that the Single View Creator will receive and execute the commands from the latter.
Check the [Runtime Management](#runtime-management) section of this page for more information.

:::caution
If you want to enable any mechanism that uses Kafka in the Single View Creator, like the [Single View Patch](/fast_data/configuration/single_view_creator/patch.md), remember to declare the following environment variables: 

- `KAFKA_BROKERS` (required)
- `KAFKA_CLIENT_ID` (required)
- `KAFKA_GROUP_ID` (required if the machanism needs a consumer)
- `KAFKA_SASL_USERNAME`
- `KAFKA_SASL_PASSWORD`
- `KAFKA_SASL_MECHANISM`
:::


## Consuming from Kafka

As you can see, the Single View Creator lets you configure what channel is used as input through the `PROJECTIONS_CHANGES_SOURCE` environment variable. The default channel is MongoDB for the [Projection Changes](/fast_data/inputs_and_outputs.md#projection-changes) but this might not always be what you need. The service gives you the alternative to listen from Apache Kafka instead, this can be useful in two different cases:

- You want to use the [Single View Trigger Generator](/fast_data/single_view_trigger_generator.md) to produce [`sv-trigger`](/fast_data/inputs_and_outputs.md#single-view-trigger-message) messages.
- You want to configure the [Single View Patch](/fast_data/configuration/single_view_creator/patch.md) cycle which reads [`pr-update`](/fast_data/inputs_and_outputs.md#projection-update-message) messsages from the Real-Time Updater.

In both of the cases you have to configure all the required environment variables related to kafka. First you need to configure the `KAFKA_BROKERS` and `KAFKA_GROUP_ID`, then you probably need to configure your authentication credentials with `KAFKA_SASL_MECHANISM`, `KAFKA_SASL_USERNAME` and `KAFKA_SASL_PASSWORD`.

Once this is done remember to set the `PROJECTIONS_CHANGES_SOURCE` environment variable to `KAFKA` and to check out the configuration page of the system you need to complete the necessary steps.

## Handling Connections with Self Signed Certificates 

Sometimes MongoDB or Kafka instances may have a TLS connection with a self-signed certification authority.

Since service version `3.9.0`, you can include additional certification authority certificates by providing the absolute path of a certification file in the environment variable `CA_CERT_PATH`. This file should be included in your project as [a Secret](/development_suite/api-console/api-design/services.md#secrets).

## Error handling

When generating a Single View, every error that occurs is saved in MongoDB following the [Single View Error](/fast_data/inputs_and_outputs.md#single-view-error) format which satisfies the schema requirements of the CRUD service, so that you can handle those errors using the Console.
It is highly recommended to use a TTL index to enable the automatic deletion of older messages, which can be done directly using the Console, as explained [here](/development_suite/api-console/api-design/crud_advanced.md#indexes).

Errors are categorized with a code that you will find in the `errorType` property of the Single View Error record.

These are the currently emitted codes:

| Code                             | Description                                                                                                                                                           | Retryable |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------: |
| NO_SV_GENERATED                  | Happens when the aggregation pipeline **unexpectedly** does not find the base projection record and thus returns empty                                                |  &cross;  |
| VALIDATION_ERROR                 | Happens when the result of an aggregation does not pass the validation defined by the user in the `validator.js`                                                      |  &cross;  |
| ERROR_SEND_SVC_EVENT             | Happens when service fails to send a Kafka message to notify a successful aggregation                                                                                                   |  &cross;  |
| SINGLE_VIEW_AGGREGATION_MAX_TIME | Happens when aggregation pipeline takes too long and goes over the maximum established time defined on the `SINGLE_VIEWS_MAX_PROCESSING_MINUTES` environment variable |  &check;  |
| UNKNOWN_ERROR                    | Happens with an unexpected error, such as a connection error with Apache Kafka or MongoDB                                                                             |  &check;  |

Notice the column retryable indicates which types of errors are sent to the retry queue when the [Single View Retry](#single-view-retry) system is enabled.

## Single View Retry

:::info
This feature is supported from version `6.3.0` of the Single View Creator
:::

The Single View Retry mechanism lets you configure a Kafka topic as a [DLQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_letter_queue) where to send the failed aggregation attempts.
Once a message is sent to that topic it will be consumed by all the Single View Creators with the Single View Retry enabled and connected to that topic, then an attempt to aggregate the failed Single View record will be performed.

First thing you need to do to enable the mechanism is to define the `KAFKA_SV_RETRY_TOPIC` alongside with all the Kafka related variables to make Kafka work in the service. 
The messages sent to that topic have the [Single View Trigger](/fast_data/inputs_and_outputs.md#single-view-trigger-message) format, that's why, if you are already listening to Single View Trigger messages on Kafka as the main input of the service you can re-use the same exact topic.

To customize the system we also offer you the environment variables `KAFKA_SV_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS` and `KAFKA_SV_RETRY_DELAY`. Check them out on the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) table.

## Runtime Management

:::info
This feature is supported from version `6.4.0` of the Single View Creator
:::

By specifying the environment variables `CONTROL_PLANE_ACTIONS_TOPIC` and `CONTROL_PLANE_KAFKA_GROUP_ID` you enable the Single View Creator to receive and execute the commands from the [Runtime Management](/fast_data/runtime_management.mdx).

By design, every service interacting with the Control Plane starts up in a paused state, unless a `resume` command that can apply to the specific service is already present in the topic. Therefore, when the Single View Creator starts up, the aggregation process will not start automatically. In this case, you just need to send a `resume` command to the resource name (namely, the Single View name) managed by the Single View Creator.
