:::caution
Throughout the Fast Data documentation we use MongoDB terminology since we use MongoDB under the hood to store all your data.
If you are not familiar with its terminology check out this [comparison with SQL terms](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/sql-comparison/).

## Fast Data terms

In this page you will find a glossary containing an explanation of the Fast Data terms, together with a link to the page where they are discussed.
