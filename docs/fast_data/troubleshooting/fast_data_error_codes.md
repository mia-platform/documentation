In this page are collected all the codes associated to errors that may be generated by Fast Data core components.  
Each error code is grouped under a specific category to help understanding which component operation may have raised the error.
Moreover, for each of them is provided a brief explanation of what caused it and which are the steps that should be taken
to potentially resolve the encountered issue.
