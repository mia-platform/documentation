This dashboard will help you to monitor unmapped fields. With unmapped field we mean a field which is in a Kafka message, but it is not included in the projection definition or it can not be casted to the desired field type.

:::info
This feature is available since Real-Time Updater v4.4.0
:::

This situation could happen for two main reasons:

- Inside the console, the field was not registered
- The [Cast Function](/fast_data/the_basics.md#cast-function) launches an error

In order to use this dashboard, the following configuration steps are needed:

- Create a MongoDB collection named `unmapped_fields`
- Set the environment variable `COLLECTION_NAME_UNMAPPED_FIELDS_STORAGE` equal to `unmapped_fields` in any _Real-Time Updater_ service you want to keep track of the unmapped fields
- Register the collection [on CMS](/business_suite/cms_configuration/config_cms.md)
- Add the [Fast Data Monitoring Application](/fast_data/monitoring/overview.md#fast-data-monitoring-application) (if you don't have it already) to add to the project the MongoDB Query Exporter service and configure it accordingly
- Configure MongoDB Query Exporter
- Create a Grafana Dashboard to read the metrics

The collection must have the following fields:

```json
[
    {
        "name": "type",
        "type": "string",
        "required": true,
        "nullable": false,
        "sensitivityValue": 0,
        "encryptionEnabled": false,
        "encryptionSearchable": false
    },
    {
        "name": "projection",
        "type": "string",
        "required": true,
        "nullable": false,
        "sensitivityValue": 0,
        "encryptionEnabled": false,
        "encryptionSearchable": false
    },
    {
        "name": "field",
        "type": "string",
        "required": true,
        "nullable": false,
        "sensitivityValue": 0,
        "encryptionEnabled": false,
        "encryptionSearchable": false
    },
    {
        "name": "lastError",
        "type": "RawObject",
        "required": false,
        "nullable": false,
        "sensitivityValue": 0,
        "encryptionEnabled": false,
        "encryptionSearchable": false
    },
    {
        "name": "__internal__kafkaInfo",
        "type": "RawObject",
        "required": true,
        "nullable": false,
        "sensitivityValue": 0,
        "encryptionEnabled": false,
        "encryptionSearchable": false
    }
]
```

Where:

- **Type**: could be `UNCASTABLE_FIELD` or `UNKNOWN_FIELD`
- **lastError**: it is the last casting error recorded. It exists only if type is equal to `UNCASTABLE_FIELD`. Moreover, the error contains, two more information:
  - **value**: The value of the field which causes the error
  - **message**: The error message
- **projection**: The name of the field's projection
- **field**: the name of the field
- `_internal_kafkaInfo`: the Kafka information generated by the document
  - **offset**: offset of the Kafka message
  - **partition**: the partition which contain the Kafka message
  - **timestamp**: the message timestamp
  - **key**: message's key

          ]
```

## Setting Alarms

An alarms system could be useful to tempestively recover these kinds of errors. The alarm system is developed to detect new unmapped fields.
To define it you need to add inside the configurations folder of your project repository the following file:

`fast-data.prometheusrule.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  name: 'unmapped-fields'
spec:
  groups:
  - name: 'fast-data.unmapped-fields.error.rules'
    rules:
    - alert: UncastableFields
      annotations:
        summary: 'Unable to cast a field'
        message: 'In namespace {{ $labels.namespace }} an error occurs while performing a cast'
      expr: '
        delta(uncastable_fields{collection="unmapped-fields", namespace="YOUR_NAMESPACE"}[2m]) > 1'
      labels:
        severity: 'warn' # debug|info|warn|critical
        # here other tags can be applied to the alert and associated Prometheus ALERTS metric
```

This system will produce an alarm every time the following condition is true: `delta(uncastable_fields{collection="unmapped-fields", namespace="YOUR_NAMESPACE"}[2m]) > 1`. Where `YOUR_NAMESPACE` is the name of your namespace.
The following condition will produce an alarm every time an error `UNCASTABLE_FIELD` is detected in an interval of two minutes.

## Panels

The Dashboard contains only one panel, named _Unmapped Unknown Fields_ and depicted in sample screenshot, that includes a single number with value equal or greater than **1** if there are new unmapped or unknown fields.

## FAQ

*How can I manage unmapped fields?*

It is possible to manage the unmapped fields:

- If you would like to neglect the unmapped field, go inside the CMS and move the document in DRAFT/TRASH
- If you would register the unmapped field, go inside the console, and he has to register it

*What happens if I register a field which previously was the source of an `UNKNOWN_FIELD` or `UNCASTABLE_FIELD` message?*

The document related to an `UNKNOWN_FIELD` field will be removed from the collection, instead, document connected to an `UNKNOWN_FIELD` with type `UNCASTABLE_FIELD` will be retained.
