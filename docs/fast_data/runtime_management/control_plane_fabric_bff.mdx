Fabric BFF, as suggested by the name, works as Backend For Frontend for Control Plane UI and it mediates requests between the frontend and Control Plane service.
Besides, it exposes the Websocket interface that enables live updates on Control Plane UI and the JSON RPC APIs for controlling Fast Data state.

## Configuration

Configuration of _Fabric BFF_ is a straightforward process that involves setting up a ConfigMap and specifying essential environment variables.

### Environment Variables

Fabric BFF can be customized using the following environment variables:

| Name                          | Required | Description                                                                                                                       | Default Value                       |
|-------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `HTTP_PORT`                   | -        | This variable determines the TCP port where the **HTTP controller** binds its listener                                            | 3000                                |
| `LOG_LEVEL`                   | -        | Specify the centralized application log level, choosing from options such as `debug`, `error`, `info`, `trace` or `warn`          | `info`                              |
| `BFF_CONFIGURATION_FILEPATH`  | -        | Set the location of the configuration file                                                                                        | `~/.fd/data-fabric-bff/config.json` |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | -        | The URL to a GRPC endpoint of an OpenTelemetry Collector.<br/>Specifying this value enables the support for OpenTelemetry tracing |                                     |

### Config Map

The configuration of the service is handled by a JSON file whose location is defined by the `BFF_CONFIGURATION_FILEPATH`. When instantiating
 [Control Plane application](/runtime_suite_applications/fast-data-control-plane/10_overview.md) from Marketplace, Fabric BFF service configuration is generated with
a dedicated Config Map, named `fabric-bff-configuration`. This file contains a template configuration that should help in configuring the service.

<SchemaViewer schema={FabricBFFSchema} />

In the paragraphs below are explained the main properties of the Fabric BFF configuration file.

#### Console Communication

In order for Control Plane application to know which [Runtimes](/fast_data/runtime_management/overview.mdx#runtime) are available for monitoring, and therefore which ones can be included in
[Runtime Views](/fast_data/runtime_management/overview.mdx#runtime-view), the service needs to contact Mia-Platform Console and retrieve the list of Projects that should be accessible from this Control Plane instance.

To achieve so, it is first necessary that your Company Owner creates a dedicated [Service Account](/development_suite/identity-and-access-management/manage-service-accounts.md)
on your Mia-Platform Console instance and assign to it the proper permissions for listing the Console projects of interest.

:::tip Good practices in permissions assignment
Pay attention to the level of access to the resources that you assign to the Service Account. 
For Control Plane use case, a good practice may be to assign the role of `guest` at Company level while granting
the `reporter` role to all the projects that should be visible by Control Plane.  
About permissions assignment, it is possible to go even more granular in case you want to allow visibility only to a subset of runtime environments of a specific project.
In fact, to do that, you may opt to assign the role of `guest` even at Project level while granting
the `reporter` role solely to those runtime environments that should be visible by Control Plane.
:::

Once the service account has been registered, your Company Owner needs to hand over to you its credentials, which are:

- `client-id` &rarr; unique identifier generated for this the service account
- [Client Secret Basic] `client-secret` &rarr; a string representing the secret needed by the service account to authenticate
- [Private Key JWT] `client-key-id` &rarr; unique identifier of the key employed for generating for this the service account
- [Private Key JWT] `private-key` &rarr; private key in PEM format

These details then should be inserted in your Fabric BFF service configuration under the `console` property. In particular, the fields to be set are:

- `target` &rarr; specifies the base URL of your Mia-Platform Console instance
- `auth` &rarr; defines how the Fabric BFF service should authenticate on Mia-Platform Console APIs, that is the service account credentials

:::caution
It is responsibility of your Company Owner to ensure that service account credentials are properly processed according to your company security policies.

Furthermore, it is of <u>extreme importance</u> understanding that **any** Control Plane user will be able to list the project name
and available environments of all the projects that can be accessed by the service account configured on Fabric BFF. 
:::

This is and example of `console` property configuration:

<FabricBFFCredentialsViewer />

:::tip
The following properties support [secret resolution](/fast_data/configuration/secrets_resolution.md):
- `console.rest.target`
- `console.rest.auth.credentials.clientId`
- `console.rest.auth.credentials.clientKeyId`
- `console.rest.auth.credentials.privateKey`
:::

A custom x509 certificate can be added to the default root keychain of certificates for any client/reversed-proxy reached by Fabric BFF.
Custom certificate must be mounted on local file system of Fabric BFF and referenced in the configuration at 'settings.tls.certificate'
as a [secret](/fast_data/configuration/secrets_resolution.md).

#### Control Plane Communication

Communication between Fabric BFF and Control Plane services occur both via [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) and HTTP REST requests. For this reason its necessary to
configure on the Fabric BFF the addresses where to reach Control Plane service. This can done by setting the properties `rest` and `grpc` of `controlPlane` field in the Fabric BFF configuration.
In both properties, the `target` field should be set to the address where Control Plane service exposes the corresponding one.

Here can be found an example of configuration that assumes Fabric BFF and Control Plane services are deployed within the same K8s namespace:

```json
{
  // ...other fabric bff configurations
  "controlPlane": {
    "rest": {
      "target": "<control-plane-service-name>"                // when protocol is http, it is not necessary specifying it. When port is not specified, it is assumed the 80 is employed
    },
    "grpc": {
      "target": "http://<control-plane-service-name>:50051"   // it is important to notice that GRPC connection uses a different port from the REST target
    }
  },
  // ...other fabric bff configurations
}
```

#### Persistence Layer


:::info
Currently only [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com/) is supported as persistence layer for storing relevant data, such as the one related to operations' auditing.
:::

:::caution
The MongoDB database selected for storing Control Plane data **must be configured to have [`replicaSet` enabled](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/replication/)**, since
Fabric BFF exploits features that can be used only when a `replicaSet` is available.
:::

In order to carry out all its operations, Fabric BFF requires a _persistence layer_ where relevant information, such as auditing details, are stored. This configuration can be set under
the `persistence.configuration` key of the configuration file. The main properties are:

- `url` &rarr; the connection string to your MongoDB instance;
- `database` &rarr; the database name where to search for the  collections relevant to Fabric BFF service. Please notice that setting this property will **override** the database
name potentially set in the connection string;

An example of persistence configuration can be seen below:

```json
{
  // ...other fabric bff configurations
  "persistence": {
    "type": "mongodb",
    "configuration": {
      "url": "mongodb://<server>:27017/<default-database>?replicaSet=local",
      "database": "<data-fabric-database-name>"
    }
  },
  // ...other fabric bff configurations
}
```

:::tip
The following properties support [secret resolution](/fast_data/configuration/secrets_resolution.md):
- `persistence.configuration.url`
- `persistence.configuration.database`
:::

#### Service Settings

Additionally, the Fabric BFF service itself has a set of properties for changing its behavior. Here are listed the available ones within `settings` properties:

- `apiPrefix` &rarr; the base path applied to all the exposed routes. It defaults to `/`;
- `auditUserHeader` &rarr; specifies in which HTTP header can be found the user identifier set by the authentication system. The value of this header will be employed to correlate requests stored by
    the auditing system with the user that performed them. When using Mia-Platform Authentication and Authorization services this property can be set to `miauserid`.  
    In case it is not set the auditing system does not correlate users with requests;

Here can be found a configuration example:

```json
{
  // ...other fabric bff configurations
  "settings": {
    "apiPrefix": "/",
    "auditUserHeader": "miauserid"
  }
}
```
