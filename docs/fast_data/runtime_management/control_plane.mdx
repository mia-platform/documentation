Fast Data Control Plane is the service that:

* keeps track of the state of the different pipelines of a runtime;
* receives user's interaction with the dedicated frontend, to update pipeline's state accordingly;  
* receives feedbacks from workloads, to acknowledge that they're up-and-running in the pipelines they've been linked to. 

## State Persistence

The Control Plane stores for each runtime the latest state of all pipelines (either domain or single view) and its artifacts in a MongoDB collection, 
that is queried directly by the service at startup to retrieve the latest available state. 

:::info
To discover more about state persistence configuration, you can check [its dedicated section](?control-plane-configuration=persistence#persistence)
:::

This collection can change based on user interactions through the frontend.

## Runtime Communication

Communications to/from runtime's workloads happen through two different channels, namely _State Channel_ and _Feedback Channel_.

:::

### State Channel

The _State Channel_ is where the Control Plane sends the current state of each pipeline. Each pipeline has a general state, that can be overridden.

For each pipeline, there could be different `overrides` that can change individually the state of a particular artifact.

Also, each artifact can have additional `overrides` for each stage of the pipeline where is employed. 

The state that can be set at pipeline level, or artifact level, or stage level is an _Activation State_: it can either `pause` or `resume`, 
which will be used by workloads to stop/resume consumption of data. 

<JSONSchemaViewer schema={StateChannelSchema} />

### Feedback Channel

The _Feedback Channel_ is where the workloads will notify the Control Plane about the state of their artifacts. This is needed to inform the Control Plane that:

- the artifacts are up-and-running;
- the workloads have their state updated correctly after a message from the state channel

The workloads will send messages through the feedback channel **periodically**.

<JSONSchemaViewer schema={FeedbackChannelSchema} />

## Endpoints

Here's a list of endpoints made available by the Control Plane. 

| Endpoint                    |     Type    |                                Description                                                 |
| ----------------------------|-------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `/fast-data/configurations` |    REST     |  Returns the pipelines from the runtime where Control Plane has been deployed.             |
| `/fast-data/feedback/:id`   |  Websocket  |  Opens a websocket connection with the client to send/receive updates for a given pipeline.|

:::tip
The prefix for the endpoint can be customized in the [Settings configuration](?control-plane-configuration=settings#settings).
:::

## Configuration

_Configuration of Control Plane_ is a straightforward process that involves setting up a ConfigMap and specifying essential environment variables.

### Environment Variables

Control Plane can be customized using the following environment variables:

| Name                                      | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                               | Default Value                              |
|-------------------------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `HTTP_PORT`                               | -        | This variable determines the TCP port where the  ** HTTP controller **  binds its listener.                                                                               | 3000                                       |
| `LOG_LEVEL`                               | -        | Specify the centralized application log level, choosing from options such as  `debug` ,  `error` ,  `fatal` ,  `info` ,  `silent` ,  `trace` , or  `warn` .               | `info`                                     |
| `FD_CONTROL_PLANE_CONFIGURATION_FILEPATH` | -        | Set the location of the configuration file.                                                                                                                               | ` ~/.fd/control-plane/configuration.json ` |

### Config Map 

The configuration of the service is handled by a JSON file whose location is defined by the `FD_CONTROL_PLANE_CONFIGURATION_FILEPATH`.

The [Control Plane applications](/runtime_suite_applications/control-plane/10_overview.md) provide a sample of this JSON in a dedicated Config Map, named `config map`.

:::info
Initially, only the persistence layer is required to be available at startup, as there could be no Fast Data runtime available.

#### Persistence

The object `persistence` configures the layer of runtime state persistence where Control Plane stores the next desired state for its runtime.

It must point to a `MongoDB` collection, available in a [`replicaSet` enabled database](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/replication/).

Available interfaces include:

- `MongoDB` client

###### Example

```json
{
    // ...other control plane configurations
    "persistence": {
        "type": "mongodb",
        "configuration": {
            "url": "mongodb://localhost:27017/fast-data?replicaSet=local"
        },
        "collection": {
            "name": "runtime-state"
        }
    }
    // ...other control plane configurations
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="runtime" label="Runtime">

#### Runtime

The object `runtime` configures: 

- the state channel that the Control Plane uses to dispatch the next desired state;
- the feedback channel where Control Plane receives workloads feedbacks about their inner states. 

Available interfaces are:

#### Kafka 

Both feedback and state channels can be managed by a Kafka broker. In particular:

- the state channel will have a Kafka Producer that sends desired states to a dedicated topic (referred to as _Action Topic_)
- the feedback channel will have a Kafka Consumer that reads workloads feedbacks from a dedicated topic (referred to as _Heartbeat Topic_)

###### Example

```json
{
    // ...other control plane configurations
    "runtime": {
        "feedback": {
          "configuration": {
            // to see all the available configuration options, go over the JSON schema
            "allow.auto.create.topics": "true",
            "bootstrap.servers": "localhost:9094"
          },
          "consumer": {
            "topic": "heartbeat-topic",
            "group.id": "control-plane-group-id"
          },
          "type": "kafka"
        },
        "state": {
          "configuration": {
            // to see all the available configuration options, go over the JSON schema
            "allow.auto.create.topics": "true",
            "bootstrap.servers": "localhost:9094"
          },
          "producer": {
            "topic": "action-topic"
          },
          "type": "kafka"
        }
    }
    // ...other control plane configurations
}
```

#### gRPC

Both feedback and state channels can be managed by a [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) server instance managed by the Control Plane, 
which creates a [bi-directional streaming remote procedure call](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/core-concepts/#bidirectional-streaming-rpc) that:

- receives feedbacks from workloads
- dispatch states to services 

##### Example

```json
{
    // ...other control plane configurations
    "runtime": {
        "feedback": {
          "type": "grpc"
        },
        "state": {
          "type": "grpc"
        }
    }
    // ...other control plane configurations
}
```

:::info 
By default, the gRPC server is exposed over the default gRPC protocol port (50051). 
This value can be overridenn in the [`settings` section](?control-plane-configuration=settings#settings) 
::: 

#### gRPC + Kafka 

It's also possible to have:

- a state channel managed by a topic in a Kafka broker;
- a feedback channel managed by a gRPC server with a [client-side streaming request](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/core-concepts/#client-streaming-rpc).

###### Example

```json
{
    // ...other control plane configurations
    "runtime": {
        "feedback": {
          "type": "grpc"
        },
        "state": {
          "configuration": {
            // to see all the available configuration options, go over the JSON schema
            "allow.auto.create.topics": "true",
            "bootstrap.servers": "localhost:9094"
          },
          "producer": {
            "topic": "action-topic"
          },
          "type": "kafka"
        }
    }
    // ...other control plane configurations
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="settings" label="Settings">

#### Settings

The overall setup of Control Plane is tuned in the `settings` object, allowing you to configure several aspects of the services, such as:

- channels setup, including:
  - buffer timeout used to delay state channel notifications
  - gRPC server configuration
  - runtime heartbeat in milliseconds, used to tell whether a workload is alive or not 
- server APIs, including:
  - Fast Data control endpoint
  - Metrics
  - Probes
- Frontend/Website endpoint locations

###### Example

```json
{
    // ...other control plane configurations
    "settings": {
        "server": {
          "prefix": "/control-plane/",
          "website": {
            "url": "/"
          }
        }
    } 
    // ...other control plane configurations
}
```
