In order to ensure that only authorized people can access Fast Data Runtime Management system and consequently
visualize or change its state, it is important to properly set up a security layer.

In the following page are described the requirements and the process that has to be carried out to achieve your goal. It
is inspired from this [guide](/console/tutorials/configure-marketplace-components/auth-architecture/external-idp-internal-session.md).

## Requirements

- access to [Control Plane With Access Control](/fast_data/runtime_management/overview.mdx) application, which automatically
  scaffold the configurations regarding microservices, collections, endpoints and variables needed for controlling Fast Data
  runtime and protecting its access. Generated resources need to be further customized depending on your needs and credentials.
- an introduction to [Envoy](https://envoyproxy.io/), which is employed as API Gateway by the application. It is also
  possible to employ [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) as API Gateway, though the focus of this guide is on the former.
- an introduction to [RÃ¶nd](https://rond-authz.io/), which is the underlying system this guide will rely on for protecting
  the access to Fast Data Runtime Management application.
- an Identity Provider, which manages users' identities. The one employed throughout this guide is [Okta](https://www.okta.com/),
  although any other Identity Provider supported by the Mia-Platform [Authentication Service](/runtime_suite/authentication-service/10_overview.md)
  can be adopted in place of Okta within this guide.

## Control Plane Configuration

Let's start by selecting the `Fast Data Control Plane` application from the Marketplace, under the applications tab:

![Fast Data Control Plane application in Console marketplace](img/marketplace_runtime_mngm_app.png)

Then proceed step by step with the creation of the needed services, endpoints and collections. Once finalized, all those resources
should appear in the different Console section.

![Summary of Fast Data Control Plane application](img/marketplace_runtime_mngm_app_creation.png)

Among them, there are the two services in charge of deploying the  Fast Data Runtime Management, which are:

- `control-plane`, which is responsible for dispatching actions to the deployed Fast Data runtime and provide the current runtime configuration to the frontend
- `control-plane-fe`, which is the UI tool for visualizing Fast Data runtime state and interact with it

In order to properly access Fast Data runtime, it is necessary to fill in all the necessary configuration in the service
config map, which they may vary depending on your Fast Data configuration.

For more details on the Control Plane service configuration, please head over the dedicated [documentation section](/runtime_suite_applications/control-plane/20_configuration.mdx).

## Authentication Flow

In this section are described which resources should be configured in order to properly protect the access to the Fast Data
Runtime Management solution.

### Services

Upon application instantiation, the following services should have been generated for handling the authentication flow:

- [`api-gateway`](/runtime_suite/envoy-api-gateway/overview.md), which is the entrypoint of your project requests
- [`authentication-service`](/runtime_suite/authentication-service/10_overview.md), which is the service that interact with your Identity Provider to request a user identity verification
- `control-plane-login-site`, a frontend employed for handling the authentication flow in the browser
- `redis-auth`, a small instance of Redis OSS (< v7.4) with no disk persistence, which is employed to support the authentication flow

#### Api Gateway

No further configuration is needed for this service in Console _Design_ section.

#### Authentication Service

The service configuration is created with a set of preconfigured variables, such as the connection to Redis, and a config map
that lists the supported applications. Within the latter config map it is possible to find the definition of an application
that uses Okta as Identity Provider.

:::info
In case you would prefer using another Identity Provider, please read the [authentication-service documentation](/runtime_suite/authentication-service/20_configuration.mdx) to learn
how to configure the desired one in place of Okta.
:::

The configuration of included application only requires to set up few public and secret environment variables to be operational.
These variables are summarized in the tables below, divided for location where they should be stored. In fact, the former ones
should be added under the _Variables_ tab of _Project Overview_ section, while the latter can be configured in the _Public Variables_ of the _Design_ section.

| Secret Variable       | Explanation                                                               |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CP_OKTA_CLIENT_ID     | client id obtained when registering this specific application on Okta     |
| CP_OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET | client secret obtained when registering this specific application on Okta |

| Public Variable | Explanation                                                                                                         |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OKTA_BASE_URL   | base url where your Identity Provider is exposed                                                                    |
| CP_APP_ID       | application identifier employed when registering this specific application on Okta (e.g. `fast-data-control-plane`) |
| CP_PROVIDER_ID  | provider identifier employed when registering this specific application on Okta (e.g. `okta-development`)           |
| CP_BASE_URL     | base url where the project is exposed                                                                               |

:::note
After the creation of the Control Plane application, the public variables specified above should already appear in the
corresponding section, each of them with an empty value.
:::

Filling the variables listed above allows to generate a complete configuration at deploy time. An example of such configuration for Okta
can be fond in the panel below.

    }
  }
}
```

</details>

#### Control Plane Login Site

No further configuration is needed for this service.

#### Redis Auth

This service is preconfigured with a config map containing the initial Redis configuration, such as the disk persistence
management and a dedicated user with their ACLs. To complete the configuration it is necessary to create the following
secret environment variables in the _Project Overview_ section:

| Secret Variable          | Explanation                                                                                                                                            |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CP_REDIS_MASTER_PASSWORD | root password to allow Redis start (not used by any service - it can be loaded from a secret when configured within the service environment variables) |
| CP_REDIS_USERNAME        | username of the Redis account to be employed by the authentication-service for accessing Redis                                                         |
| CP_REDIS_PASSWORD        | password of the Redis account to be employed by the authentication-service for accessing Redis                                                         |

<details><summary>Redis Auth Service | Configuration Example (with variables to be interpolated)</summary>

```text title=redis.conf
## GENERIC ##
port 6379
# listen on all the interfaces for incoming connections

```

</details>

### Endpoints

Below is reported the list of endpoints that have already been created for you by the application instantiation. Please
ensure that they are exposed with the proper security options.

| Endpoint        | Service                  | Authentication Required | User Group Permission |
|-----------------|--------------------------|:-----------------------:|-----------------------|
| `/web-login`    | control-plane-login-site |            -            | true                  |
| `/authorize`    | authentication-service   |            -            | true                  |
| `/oauth/token`  | authentication-service   |            -            | true                  |
| `/logout`       | authentication-service   |            -            | true                  |
| `/refreshtoken` | authentication-service   |            â            | true                  |
| `/userinfo`     | authentication-service   |            â            | true                  |
| `/apps`         | authentication-service   |            -            | true                  |

Knowing these endpoints are exposed, it is now possible to configure the redirect urls that some Identity Providers, such as Okta or Auth0, require to complete
the application registration. These endpoints will be then employed during the authentication flow to constrain the redirects
the Identity Provider can perform. In this case the endpoint that should be configured are the following ones:

- Sign-in redirect URIs â `<project-base-url>/web-login/oauth/callback`
- Sign-out redirect URIs â `<project-base-url>/logout`

where `<project-base-url>` is the base url where the project of interest is exposed to.

### Collections

The authentication flow via the `authentication-service` requires also the introduction of a CRUD Collection, where
users details are saved upon successful login. These user (_subject_) information can then be employed in the authorization flow, which is
described later, in conjunction with [policies](#policies) and [roles](#roles) to ensure that only authorized users can
visualize or interact with Fast Data runtime.  
By default the `Fast Data Control Plane` application creates the collection for you and instantiate the CRUD Service,
which is employed by the authentication service to access the collection. Additionally, below it is also provided the
collection definition ready for being imported, in case it may be necessary to move or replicate the collection in another Console project.

### Advanced

In this section are described the tweaks to be carried out on the API Gateway (Envoy) that enhance the interaction with
the runtime system and allows the solution to properly work in your project.
These modifications should be inserted in the proper file in the **advanced** tab of the Console _Design_ section, under
the key `api-gateway-envoy`.

![Console advanced tab in Design section showing 'api-gateway-envoy' configuration](img/advanced_section_envoy.png)

:::caution
Please notice that the following configuration are specific for the `frontend` listener of Envoy. In case it has been
decided to expose the Fast Data Runtime Management system under a [different listener](/development_suite/api-console/api-design/listeners.md),
please update the configuration accordingly.
:::

#### Automatic redirect upon receiving 401 HTTP error

This configuration edit should be inserted in the file `local-replies.yml` and it enforces a redirect to the login
page every time a 401 HTTP error is encountered by the system. This ensure that the user authenticates before returning
to the page they were trying to browse.

```yml title=local-replies.yml
- listener_name: frontend
  filter:
    status_code_filter:
      comparison:
        op: EQ
        value:
          default_value: 401
          runtime_key: key_b
  status_code: 302

        </head>
      </html>
  headers_to_add:
    - header:

    - header:
        key: "Set-Cookie"
        value: "sid=; Max-Age=0"
      append: false
```

#### Extend functionalities of gateway listener

This configuration edit should be inserted in the file `patches.yml` and it performs the following changes:

- introduce the support to [_Websocket connection upgrade_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Protocol_upgrade_mechanism#upgrading_to_a_websocket_connection),
  which is achieved by specifying the [`upgrade_type`](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.29.3/api-v3/extensions/filters/network/http_connection_manager/v3/http_connection_manager.proto#envoy-v3-api-msg-extensions-filters-network-http-connection-manager-v3-httpconnectionmanager-upgradeconfig) under the `filter_chains.0.filters.0.typed_config.upgrade_configs` key
- override the default headers that are added to the HTTP response, so that `X-Frame-Options` is removed and the frontend
  can be embedded as iframe

It is important to observer that both modifications affect the first [filter chain](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.29.3/api-v3/config/listener/v3/listener_components.proto#config-listener-v3-filterchain) and subsequently the first [filter](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.29.3/api-v3/config/listener/v3/listener_components.proto#envoy-v3-api-msg-config-listener-v3-filter) definition.

```yaml title=patches.yml
- listener_name: frontend
  'filter_chains.0.filters.0.typed_config.upgrade_configs':
    upgrade_type: "websocket"
  'filter_chains.0.filters.0.typed_config.route_config.response_headers_to_add': [
    {

:::note
In case your project does not employ Envoy as API Gateway, please remember to adapt your API Gateway configuration
accordingly to support the runtime management system features, such as [_Websocket connection upgrade_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Protocol_upgrade_mechanism#upgrading_to_a_websocket_connection).

## Authorization

In this section are described which resources should be configured in order to properly grant the access
to the Fast Data Runtime Management solution only to authorized users.

### Services

#### Authorization Service

This service is introduced with the application creation and it is already preconfigured with all the necessary configs.
In case the service already existed in your project, please ensure the following environment variable on the service contains
the following values

| Environment Variable | Value                                                                                                                                          |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HEADERS_TO_PROXY     | connection,upgrade,sec-websocket-protocol,sec-websocket-version,x-request-id,request-id,cookie,authorization,client-type,host,x-forwarded-host |
| USERINFO_URL         | http://authentication-service/userinfo                                                                                                         |

In order to support real-time updates in the Fast Data Runtime Management system, it is important to allow proxying the following
headers:
- [`connection`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Connection)
- [`upgrade`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Upgrade)
- [`sec-websocket-protocol`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Protocol_upgrade_mechanism#websocket-specific_headers)
- [`sec-websocket-version`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Protocol_upgrade_mechanism#websocket-specific_headers)

#### RÃ¶nd

Once all the services are ready, it is necessary to protect them. To achieve so, in this guide we are going to rely on [RÃ¶nd](https://rond-authz.io/),
which allows to define for each service's endpoints the proper access policies. Hence, let's enable RÃ¶nd sidecar for the following
two services:

- `control-plane` â to regulate who can retrieve Fast Data runtime configuration and change its runtime status
- `crud-service` â to regulate who can access roles and bindings (discussed later)

An example of RÃ¶nd enabled for these services can be observed in the image:

![List of services with RÃ¶nd enabled](img/rond_enabled_services.png)

#### Control Plane

Control Plane service is able to automatically instruct RÃ¶nd sidecar on which policies it should employ. This is obtained
by augmenting the OpenAPI Specification generated by the service with the `x-rond` property in each defined path,
as explained in the [documentation](https://rond-authz.io/docs/configuration#openapi-specification-file).

In particular, Control Plane service expects the name of two types of policies, one that allows viewing Fast Data runtime
configuration and status (e.g. `fd_control_plane_allow_view`) and one for interacting with it (e.g. `fd_control_plane_allow_edit`),
that is changing its components' state. These two policies name can be configured within the `settings` object that is found
within the service configuration config map, as follows:

```json
{
  ...
  "settings": {
    "server": {
      "apis": {
        "controllers": {
          "settings": {
            // this key defines which policies should be adopted
            "policies": {
              "edit": "fd_control_plane_allow_edit",
              "view": "fd_control_plane_allow_view"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

### Policies

:::info
For more in-depth explanation on how to configure RÃ¶nd policies please head to the dedicated [documentation page](/console/tutorials/protect-your-endpoints-with-policies.mdx).
:::

RÃ¶nd Policies are set of rules that specify which constraints must be satisfied in order to grant the access to the protected
resources, such as endpoints. For example, an authenticated user might need to own a specific _permission_, have a particular _role_ or
belong to a _group_ with the proper grants. Furthermore, the request might require headers with proper values or even ad-hoc headers from
which request and user metadata are extracted.

In the previous paragraph it is described how to enable RÃ¶nd for the pods of interest, which occurs within the _Authentication Management_ panel
of Console _Design_ section. In the same panel, under the _policies_ tab, it is possible to define the policies and their rules.
The specific panel tab is depicted in the image below:

![Authentication Management panel in Console](img/auth_management_policies.png)

Upon clicking the <kbd>Edit policies</kbd> button, a modal opens with two code blocks. On the left it is possible to write
the policies and their rules to be satisfied by requests, while on the right the code block allow to implement multiple
tests to verify that written rules adhere to expected behavior, granting the access only to correct users.

In the context of Fast Data Runtime Management application, it is recommended to set up the following four different policies,
each of them with its own purpose for controlling which user can access the different features:

| Policy Name                   | Explanation                                                        |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `allow_all`                   | no permission is required to access the resource                   |
| `allow_manage_cp_users`       | users need the permission to manage Control Plane users            |
| `fd_control_plane_allow_view` | users need the permission to view runtime configuration and status |
| `fd_control_plane_allow_edit` | users need the permission to edit runtime status                   |

:::info
When RÃ¶nd is enabled for a pod, then the default policy is _deny-all_ the incoming connections. For this reason it is also
useful to introduce the `allow_all` policy,
:::

In the code block show below are reported the policies definitions that are named in the table above. These can be copied directly within in your project
_Authentication Management_ section alongside their tests. 

```rego title="Authorization Management Policies"
package policies

allow_all {
  true
}

default allow_manage_cp_users = false
allow_manage_cp_users {
  # extract the roles associated to the user who performed the request
  userRoles := input.user.roles[_]
  
  # for each role, verify whether it has the permission to manage users 
  userRoles.permissions[_] == "console.data-fabric.control-plane.manage"
}

default fd_control_plane_allow_view = false
fd_control_plane_allow_view {
  userRoles := input.user.roles[_]
  userRoles.permissions[_] == "console.data-fabric.control-plane.view"
}
# defining multiple times the same policy is equivalent to setting their rules in an "or" statement
fd_control_plane_allow_view {
  userRoles := input.user.roles[_]
  userRoles.permissions[_] == "console.data-fabric.control-plane.edit"
}

default fd_control_plane_allow_edit = false
fd_control_plane_allow_edit {
  userRoles := input.user.roles[_]
  userRoles.permissions[_] == "console.data-fabric.control-plane.edit"
}
```

### [Roles](https://rond-authz.io/docs/policy-integration#roles)

Roles in RÃ¶nd characterize the function a subject can assume within the application. This can be achieved by applying
specific permissions to each role, granting them different powers. For example, there can be the role of _viewer_,
which represents users that can read the Fast Data runtime configuration and state, but they cannot change it.
Similarly, the _editor_ role can represent users with the same access of the viewer, augmented with the capability
to also change the Fast Data runtime state.

In the previous paragraph we defined the policies that governs the access to Fast Data Runtime Management system. Those policies
verify the permissions associated to the roles assigned to the user requesting the resource.
For example, in the context of Fast Data Runtime Management, let's suppose user _Alice_ is assigned the runtime _viewer_ role, which
has the permission `console.data-fabric.control-plane.view`. Considering the policies definitions and the permission
the _viewer_ role has, the defined policies would act differently as follows:

| Policy Name                   |  Role  |                Is Allowed                 |
|-------------------------------|:------:|:-----------------------------------------:|
| `allow_all`                   | viewer | <span style={{color: "green"}}>Yes</span> |
| `allow_manage_cp_users`       | viewer |  <span style={{color: "red"}}>No</span>   |
| `fd_control_plane_allow_view` | viewer | <span style={{color: "green"}}>Yes</span> |
| `fd_control_plane_allow_edit` | viewer |  <span style={{color: "red"}}>No</span>   |

To allow a greater flexibility in roles management, roles details are stored within an external MongoDB collection, for example named as `rbac-roles`.
This collection is then employed by RÃ¶nd to learn which roles exists and can actually be assigned to a user, together with their associated permissions.

When used within the Console, RÃ¶nd automatically tries to create this collection definition, according to its configuration which can be edited
in the _Authentication Management_ panel. This collection definition is then read by CRUD Service, so that it can create
the needed indexes. Below it is possible to also find the _roles_ collection definition, which can be directly imported in case the
CRUD collections section if it does not already exist after enable RÃ¶nd and saved the configuration.

To cover all the main use cases of accessing the Fast Data Runtime Management system we devised three roles, which can
be loaded in the _roles_ collection. These roles are show in this code block:

```json
[
  {
    "roleId" : "control-plane-viewer",
    "name" : "Viewer",
    "description" : "A user who can visualize Fast Data configuration and its runtime state",
    "permissions" : [
        "console.data-fabric.control-plane.view"
    ],
    "__STATE__" : "PUBLIC"
  },
  {
    "roleId" : "control-plane-editor",
    "name" : "Editor",
    "description" : "A user who can visualize Fast Data configuration and modify its runtime state",
    "permissions" : [
        "console.data-fabric.control-plane.view",
        "console.data-fabric.control-plane.edit"
    ],
    "__STATE__" : "PUBLIC"
  },
  {
    "roleId" : "control-plane-users-manager",
    "name" : "Manager",
    "description" : "A user who manages the users that can access Fast Data runtime",
    "permissions" : [
        "console.data-fabric.control-plane.manage"
    ],
    "__STATE__" : "PUBLIC"
  }

### [Bindings](https://rond-authz.io/docs/policy-integration#bindings)

> A Binding in RÃ¶nd represents an association between a set of Subjects (or groups), a set of Roles and (optionally) a Resource.

Eventually, once users (subjects) and roles are defined on the database, it is then possible to match them together within
the _bindings_ collection. Similarly to _roles_ collection, the collection is managed in Console by RÃ¶nd and it adopts the
definition provided below:

To link users with their respective roles it is first necessary to create three bindings, one for each existing role as defined
in the code block reported beneath. These bindings can be imported directly in the _bindings_ collection to kickstart further operations.

```json
[
  {
    "bindingId" : "control-plane-users-managers",
    "subjects" : [],
    "roles" : [
      "control-plane-users-manager"
    ],
    "__STATE__" : "PUBLIC"
  },
  {
    "bindingId" : "control-plane-editors",
    "subjects" : [],
    "roles" : [
        "control-plane-viewer",
        "control-plane-editor"
    ],
    "__STATE__" : "PUBLIC"
  },
  {
    "bindingId" : "control-plane-viewers",
    "subjects" : [],
    "roles" : [
        "control-plane-viewer"
    ],
    "__STATE__" : "PUBLIC"
  }
]
```

Afterward, the link process executes in these steps:

- from the users collection `cp-users` is selected the user that needs to be associated
- from the found user the `_id` field is extracted as string value
- the `_id` string value is inserted as value in the `subjects` array of the binding representing the role of interest
to be associated with the selected user

For example, let's suppose that the details of _Alice_ user are the ones below:

```json
{
    "_id" : ObjectId("6606e94a0e85630ccda72486"),
    "__STATE__" : "PUBLIC",
    "providerId" : "okta",
    "providerUserId" : "user-id",
    "realm" : "my-kingdom",
    "createdAt" : ISODate("2024-03-29T16:16:10.037+0000"),
    "creatorId" : "public",
    "email" : "alice@platform.world",
    "groups" : [],
    "name" : "Alice",
    "updatedAt" : ISODate("2024-04-08T16:23:12.364+0000"),
    "updaterId" : "public",
    "username" : ""
}
```
and the goal is to allow Alice to both view and modify Fast Data runtime state. Then, the `control-plane-editors` binding
should become as follows:

```json
{
  "bindingId" : "control-plane-editors",
  "subjects" : [
    // _id of Alice user
    "6606e94a0e85630ccda72486"
  ],
  "roles" : [
      "control-plane-viewer",
      "control-plane-editor"
  ],
  "__STATE__" : "PUBLIC"
}
```

Following this change, _Alice_ user would be able to visualize Fast Data Runtime Management application and pause/resume
the state of the different components.

:::note
Changes to the roles and binding collections are independent of project deploys. For this reason, managing the runtime and
who can access it does not require further deploys.

### Endpoints

In addition to the endpoints described in the [Authentication Flow](#endpoints) section, here are described the ones that expose
all the functionalities of Fast Data Runtime Management system, both the frontend and backend components.
The backend endpoints must be protected by RÃ¶nd with the appropriate [policies](#policies), as it is described in the table below.

Please notice that in case the policies were configured in [Control Plane settings](#control-plane), then no manual route needs to be added
in the _Authorization Management_ section, since they are inferred from the OpenAPI Specification exposed by the service itself.

| Endpoint                                  | Service          | Authentication Required | User Group Permission |           Policy            |

:::caution
Please ensure that all these endpoints are set with _Authentication Required_ in their security details tab.

Add `admin` to `groups` of users that can manage the Control Plane users 


## Tips & Tricks

Use a single db to manage users
