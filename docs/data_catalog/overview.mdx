**Data Catalog** is a crucial tool for managing and governing data within an organization.  
It serves as a centralized and organized repository of metadata that describes the company’s data, including its origins, characteristics, and relationships.  
The catalog provides a clear and detailed overview of the available data resources, facilitating their access, management, and informed use.

In today’s business landscape, characterized by a growing volume of data generated and consumed, a Data Catalog becomes essential for several reasons:

* **Data Governance**: Data governance involves controlling and managing data to ensure it is accurate, consistent, and compliant with regulations. A Data Catalog helps organizations maintain data quality and ensures proper and secure data use, aiding in adherence to company policies and external regulations.

* **Data Discovery**: With the increasing complexity of business information systems and the proliferation of data, finding and accessing the right data can become challenging. A Data Catalog provides tools for searching and discovering data, improving efficiency and reducing the time needed to find information coming from numerous and heterogenous system of records.

* **Regulations and Compliance**: Organizations are subject to numerous regulations and data management laws, such as GDPR in Europe and CCPA in California. A Data Catalog facilitates compliance by tracking and documenting data origins and flows, supporting auditing and reporting activities.

* **Data Policies**: Company data policies define how data should be managed, shared, and protected. A Data Catalog helps ensure that these policies are adhered to, providing visibility and control over data management practices.

Many are the challenges that companies have to deal with every day:

* **Data Integration**: Companies often face difficulties in integrating data from different sources. Without a centralized view, obtaining a unified and coherent perspective of the data is challenging.

* **Data Quality**: Maintaining data quality and accuracy is another continuous challenge, especially when data is dispersed across various systems and formats.

* **Security and Privacy**: Ensuring that sensitive data is protected and that privacy regulations are followed and guaranteed is crucial but complex.

* **Data Access and Utilization**: Facilitating access to the right data for the right people without compromising security can be difficult to manage without a centralized system.

### Key features

Mia-Platform Data Catalog offers many powerful features for building your Data Product:

* **Data Cataloging**: Organizes and collects available information about company's system of records, tables and columns, making it easy for an analyst to find and understand the data needed for a report.

* **Metadata Management**: Provides full management of custom properties to be assigned to the collected assets for metadata enrichment.

* **Search and Discovery**: Allows users to search for and discover data using advanced queries and filters on tags and custom properties. Advanced search capabilities enables a data scientist to quickly find specific assets for data analysis.

* **Collaborative Environment**: Enables users to collaborate in searching and enriching assets in the same centralized source of truth, facilitating knowledge sharing on assets.

* **Policy Management and Access Control**: Allows to establish customized data classification levels and tagging based on data sensitivity, ensuring that asset information is handled according to its classification, such as public, internal, or confidential. Moreover, it enables access control on users, which can have read-only permissions or also metadata enrichment capabilities on assets. This ensures that only authorized users can view or modify certain data.

### Metadata Enrichment

**Metadata enrichment** is a critical aspect of managing data assets within a Data Catalog.  
Metadata enrichment refers to the process of enhancing the existing metadata with additional information that provides more context, detail, and value to the data assets.  
This additional layer of metadata can significantly improve the usability, discoverability, and governance of data assets.  
Here is summarized why metadata enrichment is so important:

* **Enhanced Data Discoverability**: Enriching metadata helps users find relevant data more efficiently. By adding descriptive information, keywords, and data classifications, users can perform more precise searches and filters, thus improving the speed and accuracy of data discovery.

* **Improved Data Understanding**: Enriched metadata provides users with a clearer understanding of what the data represents, how it should be used, and its relevance to specific business contexts. This helps users to make more informed decisions.

* **Data Quality and Consistency**: By standardizing and enriching metadata, organizations can ensure consistency in data descriptions and definitions across various datasets. This reduces ambiguity and discrepancies, leading to more reliable and high-quality data.

* **Facilitating Compliance and Governance**: Enriched metadata supports compliance efforts by clearly documenting data ownership, sensitivity levels, and regulatory requirements. This is crucial for adhering to data protection laws and internal policies.

* **Enhanced Collaboration**: Detailed and enriched metadata facilitates better collaboration among teams by providing a shared understanding of data assets.

## Setup Mia-Platform Data Catalog

Start to setup your Data Catalog Project in Mia-Platform Console.  
Find in the Marketplace:

* [Data Catalog Application](/runtime_suite_applications/data-catalog/10_overview.md), that offers pre-configured bundle of resources that allows you to easily instantiate and deploy a working Data Catalog product. Give a look at the following [documentation page](/data_catalog/data_catalog_frontend.mdx) to see how to navigate Mia-Platform Data Catalog.
* [Data Catalog Agent](/runtime_suite_templates/data-catalog-agent/10_overview.md), that is in charge of extracting metadata regarding the several tables and data structures existing on configured
sources (System of Records) of your company, in order to populate the information inside your Data Catalog to start the experience within Data Catalog frontend. Give a look at the following [documentation page](/data_catalog/data_catalog_agent_setup.mdx) to see how to setup the Data Catalog Agent to retrieve assets information and populate your Data Catalog.

Actually, thanks to Data Catalog Agent, it is possible to acquire metadata coming from different supported System of Records:  

- Oracle Database
- Postgres Database
- MySQL Database
- Microsoft SQL Server Database
- Mia-Platform CRUD Service
- Salesforce SObjects API
- SAP HANA

In summary, a Data Catalog is an essential tool for effective data management. It offers a comprehensive solution for cataloging, discovering, governing,

## Architecture

In the diagram below is shown how the services involved in the aforementioned Marketplace components are linked together. In particular, the Data Catalog FE connects with the Open Lineage service via REST APIs to retrieve
the necessary data. Open Lineage service reads datasets assets from the database where Data Catalog Agent has written the information about all the configured external connections.

In particular, in the Data Fabric Project is highlighted which components the Data Catalog applications releases.
