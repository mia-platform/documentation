Once Data Catalog application has been deployed and ready to be used, it is time to collect and gather data schemas from your systems
and transform them into datasets that are compliant to the [Open Lineage framework specifications](https://openlineage.io/docs/).  

This duty is in charge of the [Data Catalog Agent](/runtime_suite_templates/data-catalog-agent/10_overview.md), which is a component that
connects to all of your configured systems, extracts data schemas from them and forward them to the configured target.

For an in-depth explanation on how to configure Data Catalog Agent it is possible to read the dedicated [documentation section](/runtime_suite_templates/data-catalog-agent/20_configuration.md).

In the context of Data Catalog, it is important to notice that Data Catalog Agent **must** be configured with `target` set to `mia-open-lineage`, so that
the Agent would write the data assets definition in the `open-lineage-datasets`collection.

:::tip
Data Catalog Agent is a fundamental component of Data Catalog solution, since it imports, parse and process data schemas
into a format ready for Data Catalog.
:::

## Sync Assets

:::caution
This configuration step is __required__ to display data sources within [the Data Catalog UI](/data_catalog/data_catalog_frontend.mdx).

Without configuring and running it, searching for data assets on Data Catalog __will yield only empty results__.
:::

Once all the data schemas have been imported by _Data Catalog Agent_, it is __required__ to run a separate process to generate all the assets from each data schema.

A data schema, in fact, consists of at least three different assets:

- `System of Record`: represents the source where the schema is located;
- `Table`: represents the data schema itself;
- `Column`: represents a unique column within a data schema. Therefore, a data schema is linked to a specific asset for each column. 

These assets are kept in a dedicated collection, named `data-catalog-records` and already configured during the [Database Preparation](/data_catalog/database_setup.mdx) step.

### Fabric Sync

To perform the synchronization between the collection of datasets imported by Data Catalog Agent and the collection of assets useful for Data Catalog application, the following cronjob has to be configured. In this [documentation page](/development_suite/api-console/api-design/jobs-cronjob.md)
it is described how it can be configured, while here are highlighted which specific configurations of the K8s manifest:

- `<URL_TO_CONTAINER_REGISTRY>` &rarr; is the url to your Container Registry of reference;
- `data-fabric/fabric-sync` &rarr; image is employed, which should be found within your Container Registry;
- `suspend` &rarr; the cronjob must be released as suspended, since it should be launched manually only once;
- `<NAME_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_SECRET>` &rarr; name of the secret where are contained the credentials for connecting to your Container Registry;
- `MONGODB_URL` &rarr; connection string to your MongoDB database.

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: fabric-sync
  labels:
    app: fabric-sync
    # ...
  # ...
spec:
  concurrencyPolicy: Forbid
  successfulJobsHistoryLimit: 3
  failedJobsHistoryLimit: 1
  schedule: '* * * * *'
  # this job MUST be deployed as suspended, since it just run once
  suspend: true
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      backoffLimit: 1
      template:
        metadata:
          name: fabric-sync
          labels:
            app: fabric-sync
            # ...
          # ...
        spec:
          imagePullSecrets:
            - name: <NAME_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_SECRET>
          containers:
            - name: fabric-sync
              # current latest stable version of the image is 0.1.0
              image: <URL_TO_CONTAINER_REGISTRY>/data-fabric/fabric-sync:0.1.0
              args: [
                "records",
                "sync",
                "--url", # you can omit this flag by setting an environment variable called `MONGODB_URL`.
                "{{MONGODB_URL}}",
              ]
          restartPolicy: Never
```

</p>
</details>

This cronjob can then be manually triggered as [described here](/development_suite/monitoring/resources/cronjobs.md#manually-launching-a-cronjob)
every time a new execution of the Data Catalog Agent has been triggered, to update the definitions of assets with the latest dataset definitions
of your data sources.
