Once Data Catalog application has been deployed and ready to be used, it is time to collect and gather data schemas from your systems
and transform them into data assets that can browsed from Data Catalog UI.  
This duty is in charge of the [Data Catalog Agent](/runtime_suite_templates/data-catalog-agent/10_overview.md), which is a component that
connects to all of your configured systems, extracts data schemas from them and forward them to the configured target.

For an in-depth explanation on how to configure Data Catalog Agent it is possible to read the dedicated [documentation section](/runtime_suite_templates/data-catalog-agent/20_configuration.md).

In the context of Data Catalog, it is important to notice that Data Catalog Agent **must** be configured with `target` set to `mongodb`, so that
the Agent would write the data assets definition in the appropriate collection of configured database.  
The collection, named `open-lineage-datasets`, is the same from which OpenLineage component of Data Catalog
solution will read to fulfill requests performed from the Data Catalog UI.

:::tip
Data Catalog Agent is a fundamental component of Data Catalog solution, since it imports, parse and process data schemas
into a format ready for Data Catalog. Without configuring and running it, searching for data assets on Data Catalog will yield only empty results.
