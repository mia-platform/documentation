Fabric BFF, as suggested by the name, works as Backend For Frontend for Data Catalog UI and it mediates requests between frontend and Data Catalog service.

## Configuration

Configuration of _Fabric BFF_ is a straightforward process that involves setting up a ConfigMap and specifying essential environment variables.

### Environment Variables

Fabric BFF can be customized using the following environment variables:

| Name                          | Required | Description                                                                                                                       | Default Value                       |
|-------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `HTTP_PORT`                   | -        | This variable determines the TCP port where the **HTTP controller** binds its listener                                            | 3000                                |
| `LOG_LEVEL`                   | -        | Specify the centralized application log level, choosing from options such as `debug`, `error`, `info`, `trace` or `warn`          | `info`                              |
| `BFF_CONFIGURATION_FILEPATH`  | -        | Set the location of the configuration file                                                                                        | `~/.fd/data-fabric-bff/config.json` |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | -        | The URL to a GRPC endpoint of an OpenTelemetry Collector.<br/>Specifying this value enables the support for OpenTelemetry tracing |                                     |

### Config Map

The configuration of the service is handled by a JSON file whose location is defined by the `BFF_CONFIGURATION_FILEPATH`.  
When instantiating [Data Catalog application](/runtime_suite_applications/data-catalog/10_overview.md), Fabric BFF service configuration is generated with
a dedicated Config Map, named `fabric-bff-config`. This file contains a template configuration that should help in configuring the service.

<SchemaViewer schema={bffSchema} example={bffConfigExample}/>

In the paragraphs below are explained the main properties of the Fabric BFF configuration file.

#### Open Lineage Communication

Communication between Fabric BFF and Open Lineage services occurs both via [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) and HTTP REST requests. For this reason it is necessary to
configure on the Fabric BFF the addresses where to reach Open Lineage service. This can be done by setting the properties `rest` and `grpc` of `openLineage` field in the Fabric BFF configuration.
In both properties `target` field should be set to the address where Open Lineage service exposes the corresponding one.

Here can be found an example of configuration that assumes Fabric BFF and Open Lineage services are deployed within the same K8s namespace:

```json
{
  // ...other fabric bff configurations
  "openLineage": {
    "rest": {
      "target": "<open-lineage-service-name>"                // when protocol is http, it is not necessary specifying it. When port is not specified, it is assumed the 80 is employed
    },
    "grpc": {
      "target": "http://<open-lineage-service-name>:50051"   // it is important to notice that GRPC connection use a different port from the REST target
    }
  },
  // ...other fabric bff configurations
}
```

#### Persistence Layer


:::info
Currently only [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com/) is supported as persistence layer for storing relevant data, such as the one related to operations auditing.
:::

:::caution
The MongoDB database selected for storing Data Catalog data **must be configured to have [`replicaSet` enabled](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/replication/)**, since
Fabric BFF exploits features that can be used only when a `replicaSet` is available.
:::

In order to carry out all its operations, Fabric BFF requires a _persistence layer_ where relevant information, such as auditing details, are stored. This configuration can be set under
the `persistence.configuration` key of the configuration file. The main properties are:

- `url` &rarr; the connection string to your MongoDB instance;
- `database` &rarr; the database name where to search for the  collections relevant to Fabric BFF service. Please notice that setting this property will **override** the database
name potentially set in the connection string;

An example of persistence configuration can be seen below:

```json
{
  // ...other fabric bff configurations
  "persistence": {
    "type": "mongodb",
    "configuration": {
      "url": "mongodb://<server>:27017/<default-database>?replicaSet=local",
      "database": "<data-fabric-database-name>"
    }
  },
  // ...other fabric bff configurations
}
```

:::tip
The following properties support [secret resolution](/fast_data/configuration/secrets_resolution.md):
- `persistence.configuration.url`
- `persistence.configuration.database`
:::

#### Service Settings

Additionally, the Fabric BFF service itself has a set of properties for changing its behavior. Here are listed the available ones within `settings` properties:

- `apiPrefix` &rarr; the base path applied to all the exposed routes. It defaults to `/`;
- `auditUserHeader` &rarr; specifies in which HTTP header can be found the user identifier set by the authentication system. The value of this header will be employed to correlate requests stored by
the auditing system with the user that performed them. When using Mia-Platform Authentication and Authorization services this property can be set to `miauserid`.  
In case it is not set the auditing system does not correlate users with requests;

Here can be found a configuration example:

```json
{
  // ...other fabric bff configurations
  "settings": {
    "apiPrefix": "/",
    "auditUserHeader": "miauserid"
  }
}
```

## Endpoints

|---------------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/api/data-catalog` | `/api/data-catalog` | `fabric-bff` | Groups all the requests related to<br/>Open Lineage operations |

### Routes
