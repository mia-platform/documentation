## Item creation

To create a new item in the catalog, click on the "Create Item" button. This will open a user interface (UI) that guides you through the item creation process. The process is divided into the following steps:

1. **Select the Item Type**
Choose the type of item you want to create from the available options. This will determine the set of fields and attributes you need to provide during the creation process.

2. **Enter Metadata**
Fill in the necessary metadata for the item. This typically includes basic information such as the name, description, category, and any other required attributes. 

3. **Enter Specifics**
After entering the metadata, you will need to specify additional details for the item. A default schema of resources will be provided to assist you in adding the relevant specifics. This schema serves as a template to help ensure all necessary information is included and formatted correctly.

Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the item creation process. Once all steps are completed, you can save and submit the item to be added to the catalog.
