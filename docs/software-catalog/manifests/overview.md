A **manifest** is a JSON representation of an entity that can be [applied](/software-catalog/items-management/overview.md) to the Catalog.

## Item Type Definition

The manifest of an [ITD](/software-catalog/basic-concepts/10_items-types.md) contains metadata about the definition itself and specifications regarding the items of the defined type.

## Item

[Item](/software-catalog/basic-concepts/05_items-data-structure.md) manifests partially varies based on the referenced ITD: the **top-level structure** of the manifest is the same for any item, while the content of the **`resources` property** is specific for each ITD.

What follows is the formal definition of a generic manifest, with the other pages of this section documenting how the **assets** (field `resources`) should be shaped for each type.

### Categories

Items can be organized in categories with the field `catagoryId`. The available categories are pre-defined, and can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mia-platform-marketplace/public-catalog/refs/heads/main/assets/categories.json).
