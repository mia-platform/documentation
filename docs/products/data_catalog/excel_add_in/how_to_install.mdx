This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing the Data Catalog Excel Add-in on your system.

## Compatibility

The Data Catalog Excel Add-in is compatible with **Microsoft Excel Desktop** and **Microsoft Excel 365** (Excel for the web).

## Prerequisites

Before installing the add-in, ensure you have:
- A Data Catalog instance released on a Mia-Platform Console Project environment
- Valid Data Catalog authentication credentials (username and password)
- Microsoft Excel Desktop installed by your organization or access to Excel 365 online
- Network access to your organization's Data Catalog instance
- The Add-in must be deployed in the same namespace as your Data Catalog instance

## Plugin Configuration and Deployment

To configure the Data Catalog Excel Add-in software item, follow these steps:
- Enter Mia-Platform Console Project revision where Data Catalog application has been configured
- Search on the available software items and choose the Data Catalog Excel Add-in
- Click on Create button to instantiate in your Project revision the Data Catalog Excel Add-In

Once created, make sure to properly configure the necessary environment variables and configMaps.

### Environment variables

Set the `DATA_FABRIC_BASE_URL` env var with the base URL of your Data Catalog instance where the Excel Add-in is deployed (e.g. `https://my-data-catalog.example.eu`).

### ConfigMaps

Configure the `excel-add-in-config` ConfigMap with the following `configuration.json` file:

```json
{
  "api": {
    "data-catalog": "/api"
  },
  "auth": {
    "appId": "<DATA_CATALOG_APP_ID>",
    "providerId": "<PROVIDER_ID>"
  },
  "name": "Mia-Platform Data Catalog Excel Add-in",
  "version": "1.0.0.0"
}
```

Replace the following placeholders with your actual values:
- **`<DATA_CATALOG_APP_ID>`**: The Application ID configured for your Data Catalog instance in the authentication provider
- **`<PROVIDER_ID>`**: The Provider ID used for authentication in your Data Catalog setup

:::info
These authentication parameters must match the configuration of your Data Catalog instance to ensure proper integration and user authentication.
:::

Once the configuration is complete, proceed with the deploy of the plugin in the same runtime environment in which the Data Catalog application is deployed.

## Installation Methods

There are two methods to install the Data Catalog Excel Add-in, depending on your organization's setup and the Excel platform you're using.

### Method A: Centralized Deployment (Recommended for Organizations)

This method allows administrators to deploy the add-in organization-wide through the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, making it available to all authorized users.

#### Step 1: Administrator Setup

The user performing this installation step must have one of the following roles in Microsoft 365:
- **Exchange Administrator**
- **Application Administrator**

**Installation procedure**:

1. **Prepare the add-in package**:
   - Access your Data Catalog instance and download the following files:
     - `manifest.json` (available at `https://<your-data-catalog-url>/excel/manifest.json`)
     - `assets/icons/Plugin-32.png` (available at `https://<your-data-catalog-url>/excel/assets/icons/Plugin-32.png`)
     - `assets/icons/Plugin-80.png` (available at `https://<your-data-catalog-url>/excel/assets/icons/Plugin-80.png`)
   - Organize the files maintaining this folder structure:
     ```
     data-catalog-addon/
     ├── manifest.json
     └── assets/
         └── icons/
             ├── Plugin-32.png
             └── Plugin-80.png
     ```
   - Create a ZIP archive of the entire folder

2. **Upload to Microsoft 365 Admin Center**:
   - Navigate to [https://admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com)
   - Go to **Settings** > **Integrated Apps**
   - Click **Upload custom apps**
   - Upload the ZIP file you created
   - Click **Next** through the configuration steps
   - Click **Finish** to complete the upload

3. **Deploy for Organization's users**:
   - Still in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, go to **Settings** > **Integrated Apps** > **Available Apps**
   - In the search bar, type **"Data Catalog"** to find your newly uploaded add-in
   - Click on the add-in name
   - Click **Deploy**
   - Select the users or groups who should have access to the add-in
   - Confirm the deployment

:::info
After deployment, it may take a few minutes for the add-in to become available to end users.

#### Step 2: End User Activation

Each user who has been granted access and enough permissions by the administrator can follow these steps to activate the add-in in their Excel application.

**Installation procedure**:

1. **Open Microsoft Excel** (Desktop or Excel 365)
2. Navigate to the **Home** tab in the ribbon
3. Click on **Add-ins**
4. In the add-ins menu, select **Advanced**
5. Choose **My Organization**
6. Locate the **Data Catalog** add-in in the list
7. Click on it to install
8. The add-in will be installed and a new **Data Catalog** tab will appear in the Excel ribbon

### Method B: Individual Installation (Office.com Only)

This method allows individual users who have access to office.com and enough permissions to install the add-in directly without administrator intervention. **This method works only for Excel 365 (Excel for the web)**.

**Installation procedure**:

1. **Download the manifest file**:
   - Access your Data Catalog instance at `https://<your-data-catalog-url>/excel/manifest.xml`
   - Download and save the file with the `.xml` extension

2. **Install in Excel Online**:
   - Open [office.com](https://office.com) in your browser
   - Launch **Excel 365** (Excel for the web)
   - Navigate to the **Home** tab
   - Click on **Add-ins**
   - Select **Advanced**
   - Click **Upload My Add-in**
   - Click **Browse** and select the `.xml` manifest file you downloaded
   - Complete the upload procedure
   - The add-in will be installed and the **Data Catalog** tab will appear in the Excel ribbon

:::caution
Method B (Individual Installation) is only available for Excel 365 (web version) and does not work for Excel Desktop applications. For Excel Desktop, use Method A with administrator deployment.
:::

## First Access and Authentication

After successfully installing the add-in using either method, you can start using it:

1. **Open the Data Catalog tab**: Look for the **Data Catalog** tab in your Excel ribbon
2. **Access the Profile section**: In the **Setup** group, click the **Profile** button
3. **Authenticate**: A task pane will open on the right side of Excel
4. **Enter your credentials**: Use your Data Catalog username and password to log in
5. **Start working**: Once authenticated, you can start using the add-in features to pull and manage metadata!

Visit the [usage documentation](/products/data_catalog/excel_add_in/usage.mdx) to learn how to pull assets, enrich metadata, and push updates back to the Data Catalog.

## Troubleshooting

### Add-in Not Visible After Deployment

If the add-in doesn't appear after administrator deployment:
- **Wait 5-10 minutes**: Deployment can take time to propagate across Microsoft 365
- **Sign out and sign back in**: Log out of Microsoft 365 and log back in to refresh your session
- **Restart Excel**: Close Excel completely and reopen it
- **Clear Office cache**: Clear the Office cache and restart the application

### Cannot Find "Data Catalog" in My Organization

If you cannot locate the Data Catalog add-in in the My Organization section:
- **Verify deployment**: Confirm with your administrator that you were included in the deployment
- **Check permissions**: Ensure your user account has the necessary permissions to install add-ins
- **License verification**: Verify that your Microsoft 365 account has the required licenses

### Upload Fails in Method B

If the manifest upload fails when using Method B:
- **File format**: Ensure you downloaded the `.xml` file correctly (check it's not saved as `.txt`)
- **Network access**: Verify you have network access to your Data Catalog instance
- **URL accessibility**: Check that the manifest URL is accessible from your browser
- **File integrity**: Try downloading the manifest file again

### Authentication Issues

If you cannot authenticate after installation:
- **Credentials**: Verify your Data Catalog username and password are correct
- **Network connectivity**: Ensure you have network access to the Data Catalog instance URL
- **Browser settings**: For Excel 365, check that your browser allows pop-ups from the Data Catalog domain
- **Firewall**: Verify that your organization's firewall is not blocking access to the Data Catalog

### Add-in Shows Errors or Doesn't Load

If the add-in displays errors or fails to load properly:
- **Clear browser cache**: For Excel 365, clear your browser cache and cookies
- **Check SSL certificate**: Ensure the Data Catalog server has a valid SSL certificate
- **Verify URLs**: Confirm all URLs in the manifest are correct and accessible
- **Try different browser**: For Excel 365, try using a different browser
- **Check Excel version**: Verify you're using a supported version of Excel
