The **Excel Plugin** is a powerful add-in for Microsoft Excel that seamlessly integrates with the Mia-Platform Data Catalog, enabling users to import, enrich, and synchronize metadata directly from Excel spreadsheets.

This plugin bridges the gap between the Data Catalog and Excel, democratizing metadata management while maintaining data quality and governance standards.

Users authenticate with their Data Catalog credentials directly within Excel, then search and import assets into their spreadsheet. Each asset appears as a row with metadata fields.

Custom properties appear as columns with type-specific validation, ensuring data integrity during the bulk enrichment process.

Before synchronization, the plugin performs comprehensive validation, checking data types, required fields, and structural compliance. Once validation passes, the plugin pushes updates back to the Data Catalog with full audit trails, automatically generating error logs and backup sheets for transparency and rollback capabilities.

## Target Users

The plugin serves business analysts who need familiar Excel tools for metadata work, data stewards managing large-scale enrichment projects, external partners contributing without direct catalog access, and data teams collaborating asynchronously on metadata initiatives.

## Getting Started

To begin using the Excel Plugin, users need:
- Valid Data Catalog authentication credentials
- Microsoft Excel Desktop installation
- Access to the organization's Excel add-in catalog

Visit the [usage documentation](./usage.mdx) for detailed instructions on installation and operation.
