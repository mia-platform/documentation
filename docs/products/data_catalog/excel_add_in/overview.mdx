The **Data Catalog Excel Add-in** is a powerful add-in for Microsoft Excel that seamlessly integrates with the Mia-Platform Data Catalog, enabling users to **import**, **enrich**, and **synchronize** metadata directly from Excel spreadsheets.

This add-in bridges the gap between the Data Catalog and Excel, democratizing metadata management while maintaining data quality and governance standards.

Before synchronization, the add-in performs **pre-push validation**, checking data types, required fields, and structural compliance.  
Once validation passes, the add-in **pushes updates back** to the Data Catalog, automatically generating *error logs* and *backup sheets* for transparency and rollback capabilities.

The add-in serves business analysts who need familiar Excel tools for metadata work, data stewards managing large-scale enrichment projects, external partners contributing without direct catalog access, and data teams collaborating asynchronously on metadata enrichment initiatives.
