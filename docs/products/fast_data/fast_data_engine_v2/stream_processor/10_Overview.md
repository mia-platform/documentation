_Stream Processor_ is a service for transforming and manipulating messages between Kafka topics.

To transform input messages into one or multiple output messages the services
leverages a Javascript _sandbox_ to run the processing function.  
During service startup the _sandbox_ loads a user-defined function from a file,
which can be written as a Javascript ES6 module, and it exposes the module as a
function that can be called by the service code.

Common use cases for this plugin include:
- **Stateless Stream Processing**: generate a new stream starting from a source one. Input
  events may be transformed and/or filtered before being produced on the output topic.
  The output messages are generated based only on the input message.
- **Stateful Stream Processing**: similar to the previous use case, the service is able to
  transform an input stream of events into an output one, leveraging a stream state
  which can be employed to perform computations that span across multiple messages.
  Consequently, output messages are generated by a combination of the current input event
  and the actual stream state.

To enable the latter use case, the processing function can access both the input message
and a cache object, which allows reading the current state of the stream and update
it as needed.
