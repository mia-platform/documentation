# Runtime Management

## Fast Data Control Plane

Mia-Platform Fast Data includes a Runtime Management solution, **Fast Data Control Plane**.  

It provides a general overview of the Fast Data pipelines released on one or more runtime environments,
and allows users to monitor and govern the execution of their Fast Data systems.

In particular, this Fast Data suite component offers functionalities to pause and resume the 
consumption of data streams along Fast Data pipelines with just a few clicks.  

Therefore, processes such as Fast Data [Initial Load management and Full Refresh](/products/fast_data/concepts/data_loading.mdx) actions can be 
easily managed from a user-friendly web interface supported by robust backend functionalities.

### Benefits

With Fast Data Control Plane, user can govern the execution of Fast Data microservices involved 
in messages consumption along the overall data pipeline with fine-grained control.  

This Fast Data Runtime Management flexibility, enables strategic management of the runtime environment in various scenarios:

- **Strategic Resource Allocation**: 
  - Dynamically allocate resources by pausing and resuming microservices involved in messages consumption based on workload and resource availability.
  - Efficiently utilize computing resources and prioritize critical processes during peak demand
  
  This leads to performance optimization, ensuring data consistency.
- **Initial Load and Full Refresh processes management**: Govern and control initial load and full refresh processes directly from a user 
  interface without frictions and without altering your workloads configuration deployed in runtime. 
  
  For example, start the ingestion of a massive data system into the Fast Data environment. Only after the ingestion process is complete, 
  initiate the processing of updates from the Real Time Updater (and the Single View Trigger Generator if active) to generate Single Views.  
- **Performance Testing and Simulation**: 
  - Simulate different scenarios for performance testing by pausing and resuming messages consumption along pipeline.
  - Observe system behavior under various conditions to identify bottlenecks and optimize resource allocation.
- **Enhanced System Reliability**: 
  - Gracefully handle unexpected situations or system maintenance by pausing specific data pipeline steps.
  - Resume operations post-maintenance to minimize downtime and enhance overall system reliability.
