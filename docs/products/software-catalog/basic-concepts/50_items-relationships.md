The **Item Relationships** feature allows the creation of links between catalog items, or between catalog items and custom entities. This enables a structured way to represent relationships such as dependencies, ownership, or any other custom association within the catalog.

For each relationship, it is possible to:
- Select a **predefined relationship type**, or define a **custom type**
- Choose an **existing item**, or define a **custom entity**
- Specify a **version** for the related catalog entity (if applicable)

This feature provides flexibility in modeling complex interconnections between entities, supporting both standard and custom relationship structures.
