## What is Mia-Platform?

Mia‑Platform is the tool you need to turn your Company into a Digital Platform. Mia-Platform is a platform builder: it provides all the capabilities to build and manage modern digital platforms and the tools to empower your Platform Strategy. Mia-Platform is built by developers for developers: its main purpose is streamlining the development cycle of microservices on Kubernetes environments.

Mia-Platform takes care of simplifying the cloud complexity, so that you can focus on building your business products instead of wasting time setting up the platform. All the tools you need are gathered together: from the infrastructure, to the microservice orchestration, to managing the software lifecycle. Just choose the tool that fits you best, and let Mia-Platform take care of the rest.
