## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. To run the server in a container, you will need to have [Docker] installed.
1. Once Docker is installed, you will also need to ensure Docker is running.
1. Lastly you will need to a way ot authenticate to your Mia-Platform Console installation, you either have to:
    - [Create a Mia-Platform Service Account] with `Client Secret Basic`
    authorization mode (the only one supported at this time)
  the `Client Secret Basic` one.
    - Use miactl authentication: if you have [`miactl`][miactl]Â installed you can run any command to login,
     the same session will then be used by the mcp server to authenticate.

### VS Code

For manual installation, add the following JSON block to your User Settings (JSON) file in VS Code. You can do this by
pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and typing `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`. Optionally, you can add it to a file
called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace.

Once you have done it, toggle Agent mode (located by the Copilot Chat text input) and the server will start.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The `mcp` key is not needed in the `.vscode/mcp.json` file.  
> Also note that you can change the host of the Console instance to your custom installation

        "password": false
      },
      {
        "type": "promptString",
        "id": "mia_client_secret",
        "description": "Mia-Platform Client Secret",
        "password": true
      }

          "MIA_PLATFORM_CLIENT_ID",
          "-e",
          "MIA_PLATFORM_CLIENT_SECRET",
          "ghcr.io/mia-platform/console-mcp-server",
          "mcp-server",
          "start",
          "--stdio",
          "--host=https://console.cloud.mia-platform.eu"
        ],
        "env": {
          "MIA_PLATFORM_CLIENT_ID": "${input:mia_client_id}",
          "MIA_PLATFORM_CLIENT_SECRET": "${input:mia_client_secret}"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> [!TIP]
> If you want to use User-based authentication with [`miactl`][miactl] you have to omit from the env object:
>
> - `MIA_PLATFORM_CLIENT_ID`
> - `MIA_PLATFORM_CLIENT_SECRET`
