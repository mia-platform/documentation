Here is a set of prompts that we are testing just right now and will be stable soon. You can try them out! If you
provide us feedback to improve them, it will be greatly appreciated.

Remember to change the values inside the curly braces `{}` with your specific information.

## End-to-End Walking Skeleton

```txt
Create a Mia-Platform project named {projectName} that implements an e-commerce for selling items. Use the {projectBlueprint} template and the tenant {tenantName}.

Reuse all items in the marketplace/software catalog to maximize reuse and minimize code written from scratch.

Design the architecture with the following components:
- A frontend in React
- A backend for frontend in Node.js
- A CRUD service
- An API Gateway

Configure the CRUD service with collections useful to:
- Browse items and categories
- Add items to cart
- Calculate prices with discounts
- Create and manage orders
- Process payments using electronic payment methods
- Send email notifications with order confirmations and shipping updates

The user should be able to see order history and shipping status in their personal area.

Protect the personal area and payment process with OpenID Connect.

Scale all microservices from 2 to max 10 replicas.

Once everything is created, deploy in the DEV Environment and provide me the status of all services when everything is up and running.

Finally, provide the link to the application created.
```

```txt
Create a Mia-Platform project named {projectName} for a hospital management system using the {projectBlueprint} template in the tenant {tenantName}.

Use components from the marketplace where possible and include:
- A staff portal built with React
- A patient-facing mobile app backend
- A CRUD service for patient records
- A secure API Gateway with rate limiting

Configure the CRUD service with collections for:
- Patients
- Appointments
- Medical records
- Billing

Implement appointment scheduling workflows and notification services.
Ensure all patient data is secured using proper authentication and authorization.

Deploy to the DEV environment and show me the deployment status.
