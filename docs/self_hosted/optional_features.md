Mia-Platform Console offers some optional features which are disabled by default and can be enable as needed.

### Google Analytics Tracking

Google Analytics Tracking can be enabled activating the feature toggle `ENABLE_GOOGLE_TAG_MANAGER`. It can be activated by a Company Owner using the CMS, in the "Feature Activations" section.

Click "Add new" and enter the following values:

- Feature Toggle ID: "ENABLE_GOOGLE_TAG_MANAGER".
- Scope Type: "Console".
- Scope ID: leave empty.

Now, the feature is enabled in the Console and the users will see a banner asking to express a preference either they would like to enable Google Analytics Tracking or not.

Hence, this feature is activated on a per-user basis.

Google Analytics help Mia-Platform improving the Console through future updates.
