In order to upgrade Mia-Platform Console, all you need to do is to update the `mia-console` Chart version dependency in your `Chart.yaml`Â file.

:::caution
when upgrading Mia-Platform Console to a new major release, always remember that updates must be performed one major at a time. Therefore, in order to upgrade from v9 to v11 you must first upgrade to v10.
:::

```yaml title="Chart.yaml" {9} showLineNumbers
apiVersion: v2
name: console
version: "0.0.0"
kubeVersion: ">= 1.20.0-0"
description: Self Hosted Console Installation Chart
type: application
dependencies:
- name: mia-console
  version: "X.Y.Z"
  repository: "https://nexus.mia-platform.eu/repository/helm-internal/"
```

When upgrading also make sure to check if any new configuration option is available or if something has been removed.

:::info
The Chart version follows [semver](https://semver.org/) policy so any breaking change with the Chart will always be followed by a Major release. Minor releases may include new configuration options while as a general rule of thumb, patches never holds new configuration options but only internal updates and fixes.
