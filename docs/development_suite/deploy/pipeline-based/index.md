**Pipeline-based deployment** is an approach in software deployment where updates and changes to applications or configurations are initiated and directly pushed from a CI/CD pipeline to the target environment. This method allows for immediate changes to be pushed directly to the target environment. It provides **real-time control and efficiency** for urgent patches and releases. This kind of strategy is often referred to as **push-based deployment**. 


The currently supported tools for pipeline-based deployments in the Console are: 

- **GitHub**
- **Gitlab**
- **Jenkins**
- **Azure**
