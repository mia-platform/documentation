**Pipeline-based deployment** is an approach in software deployment where updates and changes to applications or configurations are initiated and directly pushed from a CI/CD pipeline to the target environment. This method allows for immediate changes to be pushed directly to the target environment. It provides **real-time control and efficiency** for urgent patches and releases. This kind of strategy is often referred to as **push-based deployment**. 


The currently supported tools for pipeline-based deployments in the Console are: 

- [**Jenkins**](/development_suite/deploy/pipeline-based/configure-jenkins.md)
- [**GitHub**](/development_suite/deploy/pipeline-based/configure-github-actions.md)
- **Gitlab**
- [**Azure**](/development_suite/deploy/pipeline-based/configure-azure-pipelines.md)

For pipeline-based deployments it is possible to leverage [`mlp`](/runtime_suite_tools/mlp/10_overview.md), Mia-Platform's command line tool responsible for creating, updating and deleting kubernetes resources based on the files generated by the Console.
