# Identity and Access Management

Mia-Platform Console allows different identities to access Companies and resources with specific levels of authorization. There are two types of identity:
- User: an actual individual whose account is configured for human-to-machine communication. Find out how to manage Users in the [User Management](/development_suite/identity-and-access-management/user-management.md) page. 
- Service Account: a non-human client which is used for automated processes and machine-to-machine communication. Learn all about Service Accounts in the [Service Account Management](/development_suite/identity-and-access-management/service-account-management.md) page. 

The Console is based on hierarchical resources: assigning specific roles and permissions to both Users and Service Accounts is important for defining responsibilities within your Companies and Projects. Discover more about it in the [Console Levels and Permission Management](/development_suite/identity-and-access-management/console-levels-and-permission-management.md) documentation.

Users with enough administrative permission on a specific Company or Project can view the existing Users and Service Accounts and perform actions on them. Here is an example of the Identities table of a Company, which can be found in the IAM (Identity and Access Management) section:
