Assigning different roles and permissions to each [Identity](/development_suite/identity-and-access-management/overview.md#identity-and-access-management) that has access to Mia-Platform Console is a key action for defining responsibilities within your platform ecosystem.
The Console is based on hierarchical levels and, for each of them, specific permissions and capabilities have been identified and can be assigned.  
Let's see how they are configured.

## Console Levels

The Console resources are organized in a hierarchical structure on three levels:

1. **Console level** is the root level regarding the general configuration of your Console. 
At this level you can configure resources such as Companies, Project Templates and Marketplace.

1. **Company level** is the second hierarchical level. A Company can contain several underlying Projects, which can inherit different kinds of information from the Company without needing further configuration. At this level, License, Clusters, Providers, Users and Service Accounts can be managed. To know more about Company configuration, check out the dedicated [documentation section](/development_suite/company/create.mdx).

1. **Project Level** is the third hierarchical level. Projects are the heart of Mia-Platform Console, allowing developers engage in creating new features and building their own platform.

## Identity Capabilities inside Console

Identities can perform a set of predetermined actions along Console levels, in accordance with a set of permissions grouped for each specific role. A brief presentation of the default Roles that can be assigned to each Identity is provided here below:

* `Company Owner`: A Company Owner has the ability to manage Company Users and Service Accounts, and has full administrative capabilities on all the Projects (and Runtime Environments) within the Company
* `Project Administrator`: A Project Administrator is able to manage identities and all other aspects of a Project, thus being able to perform any actions on all the Runtime Environments of the Project as well
* `Maintainer`: A Maintainer can edit both Project configuration and Runtime Environments
* `Developer`: A Developer can edit Project configuration and view Runtime Environments
* `Reporter`: A Reporter can view Project configuration and Runtime Environments
* `Guest`: A Guest has restricted access to data and can only view basic information for a selected subset of resources

Roles can be assigned at three types of Console resources:

* Company
* Project
* Runtime Environments

Roles can be assigned at Company level from the Identities portal of the Company Overview section.
  
The following table describes the capabilities that are granted when assigning a role at Company level:

Roles can be assigned at both Project and its Runtime Environments levels from the Identities portal of the specific Project Settings Area.

:::info
Please note that, inside Project Identities portal, only those Identities on which a Company role has previously been assigned are shown.  
For each of them, therefore, the permissions inherited from the Company role assignment at the Company level will be visible. In this way, it will be possible to identify which additional permissions among those mentioned in the following table can be assigned at Project and Runtime Environments levels.

### Console Root level permissions

User roles and permissions are manageable from CMS by **Console Super Users**, which are particular Console Administrators having access to the Console CMS and thus being able to perform actions at Console root level.

:::info
Note that Console Super User is NOT included as a default role. Consequently, it can not be assigned from the Identities portal, as it performs actions exclusively at Console root level. 
:::

The following table describes the manageable privileges at Console root level that are granted to Console Administrators:

| Capabilities | Permissions key |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Create a new Company                            | `console.root.company.create`         |
| Delete any Company                              | `console.root.company.delete`         |
| Create a new Project                            | `console.root.project.create`         |
| Edit any Project                                | `console.root.project.details.update` |
| Delete any Project                              | `console.root.project delete`         |
| View all Console resources                      | `console.root.view`                   |
| Manage identity Roles, Groups and Bindings      | `console.root.user.bind`              |
| Create and delete any user                      | `console.root.user.manage`            |
| Create and delete root service account          | `console.root.serviceaccount.manage`  |
| Manage all private and public Project Templates | `console.root.templates.manage`       |
| Manage available features                       | `console.root.features.manage`        |
| Manage all Marketplace resources                | `console.root.marketplace.manage`     |
### Role binding example

Suppose you have a feature team composed by: 1 _Project Manager_ and 1 _Technical Leader_, 1 _Senior Developer_ and 2 _Junior Developers_ and 2 _Designers_.
This team works on a single Project with two environments:

 1. Production, on which only the _Project Manager_, the _Technical Leader_ and _Senior Developer_ can perform actions, and
 1. Staging on which the 2 _Junior Developers_ can perform actions, too.

What you might want could be a similar Role Binding organization:

* The _Project Manager_ and the _Technical Leader_ may want to have full access to the Project so they can be assigned the _Project Administrator_ Role on the Project resource
* The _Designers_ should be able to access the Project but they cannot perform any editing action on it, so they can be assigned the _Reporter_ Role on the Project resource
* The _Senior Developers_ can be assigned the _Maintainer_ Role on the Project
* The _Junior Developers_ can be assigned the _Developer_ Role on the Project resource and then can be assigned the _Maintainer_ Role only on the Staging environment

#### Assigning Roles on Resources

When you wish to assign a Role on a specific resource what you have to do is create a binding with a properly configured resource object.

:::info
For more information regarding how a binding is defined and how to configure the resources check out the [following documentation page](/development_suite/api-console/api-design/authorization.md#rbac-storage).
