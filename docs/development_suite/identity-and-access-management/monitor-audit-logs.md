Thanks to the Audit Logs feature, Mia-Platform Console grants users with enough permissions to monitor actions performed by identities within a Company and its resources.

Audit logs play a crucial role in an Internal Developer Platform, especially regarding governance, security, and compliance with regulatory frameworks. For this reason, the Console offers a dedicated Audit Logs section, allowing to easily track logging activities in a central place.

## Audit Logs section 

The Audit Logs feature is available at the Company level within the "Administration" section of the Console.  
In this section, you can access a table offering a structured view of all logged activities within the Company.

This section is visible and accessible only to users with the "Company Owner" role.
