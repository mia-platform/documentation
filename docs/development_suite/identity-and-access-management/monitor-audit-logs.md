Mia-Platform Console provides an Audit Logs feature that enables users with enough administrative permissions to monitor identity actions within a Company and its related resources. Audit logs represent a crucial aspect in an Internal Developer Platform, especially with respects to governance, security, and compliance with regulatory frameworks. The goal of this section is to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of Mia-Platform Console.  

For this reason, the Console offers a dedicated Audit Logs section, allowing to easily track logging activities in a central place.

## Audit Logs section 

The Audit Logs feature is available at the Company level within the "Administration" section of the Console.  
This section is visible and accessible only to users with the "Company Owner" role and provides a comprehensive overview of recorded identities actions, that can be easily monitored.

Audit logs are displayed in a structured table format, providing the following information for each log:

## Security Concerns

Access to audit logs data within the Console is restricted to users with the "Company Owner" role, who can view an aggregated overview of logged events.  
The raw log data is only accessible to administrators managing the Console installation. This ensures that sensitive log information is protected from unauthorized access while still enabling Companies to maintain oversight of key activities.
