Providers can be generically defined as a means of storing information about external services. The Mia-Platform Console supports providers with 3 different capabilities:

* **Git Providers**: allow users to manage repositories within their workspace;
* **Secret Managers**: allow users to securely store API keys, passwords, certificates, and other sensitive data;
* **CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery) Tools**: allow users to automate one or more stages of the so-called CI/CD pipelines (which usually consist of commit, build, test, and deploy).

The following table shows the providers currently supported by the Console, grouped by capability:

| Capability     | Providers                                                           | `type` in data model                                |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Git Provider   | GitLab, GitHub, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps                             | gitlab, github, bitbucket, azure-devops             |
| Secret Manager | GitLab, Vault                                                       | gitlab, vault                                       |
| CI/CD Tool     | GitLab (Git Runner), GitHub (GitHub Actions), Jenkins, Azure DevOps | gitlab-ci, github-actions, jenkins, azure-pipelines |

## Providers Overview

Mia-Platform Console allows authorized users to manage providers. More specifically, a user can:

* Add a new connection to a provider;
* Edit the connection to a provider;
* Set a default provider for a company.

To access these features, head to the Company Overview area of the Console by clicking the related button on the home page, next to your company name.

![Go to Company Overview](img/go-to-company-overview.png)

By clicking on "Providers" you will be redirected to the related section, in which (assuming you already have some providers connected) you can see a table containing some information about the providers connected to the Console:

* **Name**: provider name, assigned by the user while connecting the provider to the Console;
* **Capabilities**: provider capabilities (Git Provider, Secret Manager, CI/CD Tool);
* **Service**: external reference service on which the provider relies to provide its capabilities (e.g. Azure, GitHub, Jenkins).

You can filter data based on provider name or service through the search bar at the top of the table, while the bar next to it allows you to filter by one or more capabilities.

![Providers overview](img/providers-overview.png)

## Connect a Provider

You can connect a provider by clicking on the "Add provider connection" button, located in the page's top right corner. A modal will show up, and, through a few steps, you will be asked to enter some information related to the provider.

### Step 1: Provider Services

![Add provider 1a](img/add-provider-1a.png)
![Add provider 1b](img/add-provider-1b.png)

In this step, you are required to choose the specific provider you want to use among the ones supported by the Console and, for the chosen provider, the capabilities you want to use it for ("Git Provider", "Secret Manager", "CI/CD Tool").

:::info
If the provider offers only one capability, clicking on it will lead directly to step 2 and the capability will be selected by default.
:::

### Step 2: Provider Details

![Add provider 2](img/add-provider-2.png)

In this step, you can insert some general details about your provider:

* **Provider name** (*required*): a human-readable name for the provider;
* **API Base URL** (*required*): the reference endpoint URL for calls to the provider APIs;
* **Base URL** (*required*): the reference endpoint URL for the provider;
* **Description**: a brief description of the provider.

### Step 3: Credentials

![Add provider 3](img/add-provider-3.png)

In this step, you are required to insert information about the authentication method to the provider, so that the Console has the necessary permissions to perform all read/write operations on it:

* **Credentials type** (*required*): the type of credentials used to authenticate requests to the provider. It can be one of "Token," "M2M," and "OAuth2".

Depending on the credentials type, the other information to be entered will be:

* For credentials of the type "Token":
  - **Access token** (*required*): the token that allows the Console to authenticate against the APIs of the provider (temporary credentials).
* For credentials of the type "M2M":
  - **Token** (*required*): the token that allows the Console to authenticate against the APIs of the provider (long-lived credentials);
  - **Access token URL** (*required*): the reference authorization endpoint URL that, to requests that include the authentication token, responds by generating temporary credentials.
* For credentials of the type "OAuth2":
  - **Access token URL** (*required*): the reference OAuth2 authorization endpoint URL that, to requests that include client ID and client secret, responds by generating temporary credentials;
  - **Client ID** (*required*): OAuth2 public client identifier;
  - **Client secret** (*required*): OAuth2 secret, known only to the client and the authorization server.

:::info
All credentials data are stored in an encrypted MongoDB collection.
For more information about MongoDB encryption, take a look at the dedicated [documentation page](/runtime_suite/crud-service/30_encryption_configuration.md).
:::

:::caution
Credentials entered at this stage, for security reasons, will never again be shown to the user, who will be able to replace them with new ones but not visualize them again.
:::

#### Supported credential types
Depending on the provider selected in step 1, the types of credentials supported will change. The following table shows the credential types supported by each provider:

| Credentials Type  | Providers                                                             |
| ----------------- |:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Token             | GitLab, GitHub, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps, Vault, Jenkins               |
| M2M               | Vault                                                                 |
| OAuth2            | Jenkins                                                               |

:::caution Assign the right scope to your credentials
Make sure, when generating credentials on the respective provider sites, to assign them a scope so that they have the necessary permissions for all read and write operations performed through the Console.

For example, for the "Token" credentials type, the access token should have scope "api" in the case of GitLab, admin scopes for GitHub, "Project admin" and "Repository admin" in the case of Bitbucket, "Full access" for Azure DevOps.
:::

### Step 4: Advanced

![Add provider 4a](img/add-provider-4a.png)
![Add provider 4b](img/add-provider-4b.png)

In this step, you can enter some optional advanced information through two expandable forms:

#### Certificate Authority

If you have set up verification of a CA for the connection to your provider, here you can enter it through the homonymous field:

* **Certificate authority**: base64 decoded CA certificate for the TLS connection with the provider.

#### Proxy

If the Console needs to use a proxy to forward calls to the provider, here you can enter the information needed for the connection:

* **URL**: the URL used to connect to the proxy, which indicates where the proxy is exposed;
* **Username**: the username used in connection requests to the proxy for basic authentication;
* **Password**: the password used in connection requests to the proxy for basic authentication. This property will be safely encrypted.

By clicking on "Add provider", the connection to the provider will be set, and it will appear as a new entry in the table.

## View Provider Information

By clicking on the arrow button located in the rightmost column of a provider entry in the table, a new page will show up, displaying information about the specific provider through 3 cards:

* **Details**: this card shows the information inserted by the user in step 2 of connecting the provider to the Console (and, in addition, the specific provider and selected capabilities), and allows to modify this information through the "Edit" button in the top right corner, as further explained [below](#edit-a-provider).

![Provider details](img/provider-details.png)

* **Credentials**: this card shows the credentials type chosen by the user in step 3 of connecting the provider to the Console, and allows to replace the credentials information through the "Change credentials" button in the top right corner, as further explained [below](#edit-a-provider).

![Provider credentials](img/provider-credentials.png)

* **Advanced**: this card shows the optional information inserted by the user in step 4 of connecting the provider to the Console through 2 tabs - "Certificate Authority" and "Proxy" - and allows to modify (or eventually add) this information through the "Edit" button in the top right corner, as further explained [below](#edit-a-provider).

![Provider advanced certificate](img/provider-advanced-certificate.png)
![Provider advanced proxy](img/provider-advanced-proxy.png)

In case a base64 CA certificate has been entered, clicking on the "View certificate" button allows the user to visualize the certificate in both human-readable and plain versions in a two-tabs modal.

The "Expanded view" tab displays the human-readable version of the certificate, while the "Text view" tab shows its plain version and a copy button in the modal footer allows the user to quickly copy the plain base64 CA certificate.

## Edit a Provider

As mentioned in the previous section, through the button in the top right corner of the Details, Credentials, and Advanced cards, it is possible to modify the information inserted by the user while connecting the provider to the Console.

A click on the button will open a modal very similar to the one seen when connecting the provider, but only specific to the information you wish to edit. 

:::info
In the Details card, the modal will allow you also to change the capabilities used by the provider, selected in step 1.
:::

In the image below for example, the user clicked the "Edit" button on the "Details" card, opening a modal for editing the information entered during steps 1 and 2 of provider creation.
By clicking on "Edit provider", the information about the provider will be updated.

![Edit provider details](img/edit-provider-details.png)

## Set a Default Provider

Once you create a provider connection, you will be able to set it as the default provider for a specific capability of that company. 

By using the dedicated cards at the top of the providers' section, you will be able to select one of the providers implementing that specific capability. 

As soon as the default provider has been set for a certain capability, the card will show the corresponding chosen provider.
If no provider has been set, a "Set default capability" button will appear instead.

![Default Providers](img/default-providers.png)

Setting a default provider for a company allows you to make that provider handle a specific capability for any project that will be created within the company.

In this way, you will not need to manually specify a provider for your projects.

:::info
Default Providers are automatically associated with newly created projects inside the company.
:::

:::caution
Please make sure to have the right permissions to set or modify the default providers of a company. 

**Only Company Owners will be able to access this feature.**
:::

#### Edit a Default Provider

You can change the default provider connection for a specific capability by clicking the edit button located in the upper right corner of the default providers' cards.

A modal will appear allowing you to select one of the providers implementing that specific capability:
![Default Providers](img/edit-default-provider.png)

Once you edit the default provider, you will be able to see the card with the new provider set.

## Associate Providers to Projects

If you haven't specified a default provider on a certain capability, or you wish to overwrite the default provider configurations on a specific project within the company, you will need to manually associate the provider with the project you want to use it for.

To do this, you can use the CMS: navigate through the `Projects` section, select the desired project, and edit the document by following the guidelines below, which specify what information to include depending on the provider type and capability.

### Edit Git Provider

:::warning
Data migration from the old to the new provider is not managed. If you want to replace the Git Provider you will have to manually migrate your repository.
:::

To change the Git Provider of a project, simply edit the `providerId` field within the `Repository` object by entering the `providerId` (obtainable from the providers' CRUD collection) you want to use instead of the previous one.

In this case there is no difference in configuration depending on the provider type, so for each of the supported providers an example configuration of the `Repository` object could be as follows.

##### Example Configuration

  ```json
  {
    "providerId": "my-provider"
  }
  ```

### Edit Secret Manager

:::warning
Data migration from the old to the new provider is not managed. If you want to replace the Secret Manager you will have to manually migrate your secret variables.
:::

To change the Secret Manager of a project, you need to edit the `Environments variables` object by replacing the values of the following fields:

* **providerId**: the unique identifier of the provider (obtainable from the providers' CRUD collection);
* **type** (*required*): one of the supported provider types. Refer to the table at the top of this page for the complete list of [supported providers](/development_suite/set-up-infrastructure/configure-provider.mdx).

In addition, you may need to include the following information, depending on the provider type:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="gitlab" label="GitLab">

  - **baseUrl**: the base path from which the variables will be read. 

    If not specified, variables will be read from the first parent group of the Configurations project in GitLab.

    As an example, if your GitLab project is saved in **`https://git.tools.mia-platform.eu/mia-platform/Test/configurations`**, the environment variables will be written in the **`mia-platform/Test`** group.

  - **storage**: additional settings related to the storage of environment variables within the GitLab installation.

    It is composed of the following properties:

    - **path**: specifies the exact location for reading variables, starting from the _baseUrl_.

    - **type**: the level of granularity with which variables are managed within the GitLab installation.

      It determines the scope within which variables will be available to the pipelines.

      Either one of the following:

      - `groups`: variables will be managed at the group level;
      - `projects`: variables will be managed at the project level.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

##### Example Configurations

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="gitlab" label="GitLab">

  ```json
  {
    "providerId": "my-gitlab",
    "type": "gitlab",
    "baseUrl": "https://my-gitlab-host",
    "storage": {
      "type": "projects",
      "path": "clients/mia-platform/configurations"
    }
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="vault" label="Vault">

  ```json
  {
    "providerId": "my-vault",
    "type": "vault"
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

In addition, it is also possible to change the Secret Manager of a specific environment within the project.
To do this, you need to modify the `environmentsVariables` object within the referenced environment in the `Environments` object
(from the CMS: `Environments` > *environment object* > `environmentsVariables`). The fields to be edited are the same as described above.

### Edit CI/CD Tool

To change the CI/CD Tool of a project, you need to edit the `Pipelines` object by replacing the values of the following fields:

* **providerId**: the unique identifier of the provider (obtainable from the providers' CRUD collection);
* **type** (*required*): one of the supported provider types. Refer to the table at the top of this page for the complete list of [supported providers](/development_suite/set-up-infrastructure/configure-provider.mdx).

In addition, you may need to include the following information, depending on the provider type:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="azure-devops" label="Azure DevOps">

- **azurePipelineId**: a unique identifier that can be used to reference and identify a pipeline.

Learn more on how to retrieve the ID of a pipeline on the Azure DevOps [pipelines documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="jenkins" label="Jenkins">

- **options**: an object containing the `view` property.

  In Jenkins, pipeline views allow you to visualize and monitor your pipelines and their status in a more organized and user-friendly way, making it easier to track their progress and health.

  The `view` configuration includes the following fields: 

  - **name**: the name of the visualization step where Jenkins pipelines are shown.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

##### Example Configurations

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="gitlab" label="GitLab">

```json
{
  "providerId": "my-gitlab",
  "type": "gitlab-ci"
}
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="github" label="GitHub">

```json
{
  "providerId": "my-github",
  "type": "github-actions"
}
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="azure-devops" label="Azure DevOps">

```json
{
  "providerId": "my-azure",
  "type": "azure-pipelines",
  "azurePipelineId": "{PIPELINE_ID}"
}
```
</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="jenkins" label="Jenkins">

```json
{
  "providerId": "my-jenkins",
  "type": "jenkins",
  "options": {
    "view": { "name": "my-view" }
  }
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

In addition, it is also possible to change the CI/CD Tool of a specific environment within the project.
To do this, you need to modify the `deploy` object within the referenced environment in the `Environments` object
(from the CMS: `Environments` > *environment object* > `deploy`). The fields to be edited are the same as described above.

## Provider APIs
For versions prior to 10.8, the above information is not valid, as providers were managed directly through APIs. Therefore, for the sake of backward compatibility, we report in this section the APIs used to create and modify providers, along with examples of request bodies:

- POST - `/api/backend/tenants/{tenantId}/providers`: used to create a new provider;
- PATCH - `/api/backend/tenants/{tenantId}/providers/{providerId}`: used to edit an existing provider.

:::info
These APIs are protected and can be used only if you belong to the group `access_token_manager`.
:::

### POST
To create a new provider, you need to call the respective API as follows:

```sh
curl --location --request POST 'https://console-url/api/backend/tenants/my-example-company/providers' \
--header 'Cookie: sid={{CHANGE_ME_WITH_YOUR_SID}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{"credentials":{"type":"token","content":{"accessToken":"my-super-super-super-secret-token"}},"id":"gitlab-id","label":"My GitLab Label","type":"gitlab","urls":{"apiBase":"https://gitlab-test.com/api","base":"https://gitlab-test.com"}}'
```

The body schema of the request should adhere to the following data model:

```json
"body": {
  "type": "object",
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "properties": {
    "providerId": { "type": "string" },

:::info Supported credential types
As discussed [here](#step-3-credentials), different types of providers support different types of credentials. The following table shows the credential types supported by each provider, referring to the data model shown above:

| Credentials Type   | Providers                                                             |
| ------------------ |:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|

:::
:::caution Data model update
The fields `capabilities` and `expirationDate` (within `credentials`) have been introduced starting from version 10.8 of the Console.
:::

Examples of request bodies specific to each provider type are shown below. In the examples, the `capabilities` and `expirationDate` fields are omitted, since it is assumed that calls to this API are made by users with a Console version lower than 10.8.

### PATCH
To edit an existing provider, you need to call the respective API as follows:

```sh
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://console-url/api/backend/tenants/my-example-company/providers/gitlab-id' \
--header 'Cookie: sid={{CHANGE_ME_WITH_YOUR_SID}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{"credentials":{"type":"token","content":{"accessToken":"my-new-super-super-super-secret-token"}}'
```

The request of this endpoint is identical to the [previous one](#post), except that the `providerId` must be entered inside the endpoint params and not in the request body.
