A company is the resource which has the governance of all the projects inside it. It is possible to connect the infrastructure on which projects can be based, analyze the configuration of all projects inside the company and manage users and permissions inside the company.

:::info
The company creation is linked to the license. If you want to create a new company, contact your Mia-Platform referent.
:::

:::caution
To create a company in the Mia-Platform SaaS Console, you must open a [Service Request](https://makeitapp.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/21/group/79/create/340) and the company will be created for you.
:::

### Requirements

To create a company, you must have access to the Console Backoffice (granted with the group `console_cms`) and permission `console.root.company.create`.

### Create a company

It's possible to create a company from API. The API is visible inside the Console API Portal, under the `Companies` tag.

The API is a POST to `/api/backend/companies`, and it is possible to set the name and description of the company to add. In addition, when you create the company you will be added as [`Company Owner`](/development_suite/console-levels-and-permission-management.md#users-capabilities-inside-console).

:::caution
This API could change in future in a not backwards compatible way
:::

In the company, you could configure:

- git providers which can be used by the project inside the company
- clusters which can be used by the projects inside the company
- default configurations to be used during the creation of new projects

Let's now configure the company to prepare itself to the creation of a new project.

#### Add the first Company User

If you used the API to create the company, you can skip this section.

If your company has been created by CMS, you have to add the first user to it, who may be yourself or another user in the Platform. Regardless, head over to the CMS page and choose the _Bindings_ menu item (only a restricted set of users have access to this section, ask your Console Administrator if you need access to it).

In the _Bindings_ section, select the _Create new_ button and fill in the form, type a custom _Binding ID_ (make sure it is unique in the whole collection, something like `{tenantId}-{desiredRole}` should be enough), select the proper Role (generally at this point you'll be adding the first _Company Owner_) and make sure to select the correct user as Subject. Finally, you'll have to assign the correct resource by filling it with an object as follows:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "company",
  "resourceId": "THE ID YOU PROVIDED UPON CREATION AS tenantId"
}
```

### Create a new Git Provider

To create a new provider, you can follow [the providers guide](/development_suite/set-up-infrastructure/configure-provider.mdx).

### Connect a cluster

To connect a cluster, you can follow [the cluster guide](/development_suite/clusters-management/add-edit-remove-cluster.md).

### Default configuration for a new project

This configuration can be done using the Console Backoffice.

The fields necessary for this collection are:

- `defaultTemplateId`: the default template to be used in the project creation. This information can be changed in the project creation wizard steps;

- `cmsImageName`: CMS Docker image to interpolate in template archive. It should also contain the CMS tag to use (if `cms-site` service is disabled in the project creation, it will not be used);

- `repository` (_required_): object which specifies the information about the repository where the projects of this company have to be created. The object must have the following properties:
  - **providerId** (_required_): `providerId` existing into the provider's CRUD. It is used to get information about the provider to use. This ID is important because it affects many requests used by the developer Console;
  - **basePath**: base path where the project will be created. The user needs to have permission for creating projects on this path;
  - **visibility**: visibility of the project.

:::info
Here some tips on how to correctly configure the `basePath` property, grouped by Git provider:

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="gitlab" label="GitLab" default>

The `basePath` is the basePath of the group where to create the project.

If the group does not exist, it will be created only if the user has the needed permission to create the group in its parent.

E.g.

- /groupA/groupB -> if groupB does not exist AND user have permission to create groups in groupA, then groupB will be created;
- /groupA/groupB -> if groupB does not exist AND user have no permission to create groups in A, then groupB will NOT be created;
- /groupA/groupB -> if groupB does not exist AND groupA does not exist, then it will NOT be created any group.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="github" label="GitHub">

The `basePath` have to be an existing organization. If it does not exist, it will not be created.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="azure-devops" label="Azure DevOps">

The `basePath` is the path where your Azure project is reachable: the pattern is `company-name/project-name`.

For example, if you project is reachable at the URL `https://dev.azure.com/mia-platform-devops/Test`, then the `basePath` must be `mia-platform-devops/Test`.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="bitbucket" label="BitBucket">

The `basePath` is the path where your BitBucket project is reachable: the pattern is `projects/project-code`.

For example, if you project is reachable at the URL `https://bitbucket.mia-platform.eu/projects/TSDB`, then the `basePath` must be `projects/TSDB`.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::

- `environments` (_required_): an array of objects containing the definitions of the environments for the company. The content of this arrays will be interpolated to replace `%projectId%` by inserting the `projectId` field in the project creation. Each object should contain, for example:

  ```js
    {
      "label": "Development",
      "envId": "development",
      "envPrefix": "development",
      "hosts": [
        {
          "host": "%projectId%.test.mia-platform.eu",
          "scheme": "https"
        },
        {
          "host": "cms.%projectId%.test.mia-platform.eu",
          "isBackoffice": true
        }
      ],
      "cluster": {
        "clusterId": "human-readable-id-of-the-cluster",
        "namespace": "%projectId%-development",
        "kubeContextVariables": {
          "KUBE_URL": "KUBE_DEV_URL",
          "KUBE_TOKEN": "KUBE_DEV_TOKEN"
        }
      }
    }
  ```

  :::caution
  The term _tenantId_ refer to the actual company new terms.
  :::

  :::warning
  Do not set in the `cluster.kubeContextVariables` object the plain values to access the cluster. Write the variable key name for the specified environment (as shown in the example). The values saved here are not encrypted!
  :::

- `pipelines` (_required_): the CI/CD pipelines used by the company, for example:

  ```json
  {
    "type": "gitlab-ci"
  }
  ```

- `environmentVariables`: an object which describes the configuration to enable the Variables section in the Project Settings area of the Console. The only supported type is `gitlab`.

  There are three ways to configure a project:

  1. **empty**: it is not set as default in the project creation, but should be configured manually after the process;

  2. **only type configuration**, for example:

     ```json
     {
       "type": "gitlab"
     }
     ```

     The project reads the variables from the first parent group of the Configurations project in GitLab.

     As an example, with a GitLab project to be saved in `/clients/mia-platform/configurations`, the environment variables are written in the `clients/mia-platform` group;

  3. **complete configuration**, for example:

     ```json
     {
       "type": "gitlab",
       "baseUrl": "https://my-gitlab-host",
       "storage": {
         "type": "projects",
         "path": "clients/mia-platform/configurations"
       }
     }
     ```

     This configuration is saved only within the company, and should be retrieved at runtime in project fetching from company info. So if your company has all environment variables of the projects set in the parent group, this setting might be changed for all projects at the same time.

- `logicalScopeLayers`: an array of objects identifying the set of logical layers available in the current company. Each object is shaped as follows:

  - **name**: identifies the name of the logical layer;
  - **order**: identifies the numerical order of the layer, in order to display it according to the sorting defined by the user.
    When a project is merged with its company information, the `logicalScopeLayers` will be created in the project model according to its `layerId` value. Please refer to the section [How to create a project on Console] for further details.

- `availableNamespaces`: namespaces internally accessible from your project, using the `cross-projects` endpoint. It is useful when your company is made up of several projects that communicate with each other. The content of this array will be interpolated to replace `%projectId%` with the `projectId` field in the project creation;

- `dockerImageNameSuggestion`: object which defines the Docker image name suggestion that will be passed to every project created in your company. This suggestion will appear in the `Docker Image Name` field when you [create a microservice](/development_suite/api-console/api-design/services.md#how-to-create-a-microservice-from-an-example-or-from-a-template).
  The object should have the following properties:

  - **type** (_required_): string which defines the type of suggestion. Currently, there exist three types:

    - `PROJECT_ID` (_default_): the suggestion for the Docker image name will be in the following format: `<project-id>/<your-service-name>`. This is the default behavior, even without setting this property the suggestion will follow this format. You must **not** set the `prefix` property if you have chosen this type;
    - `REPOSITORY`: the suggestion for the Docker image name will be in the following format: `<your-group-name>/<your-repo-name>`. You must **not** set the `prefix` property if you have chosen this type;
    - `CONSTANT_PREFIX`: the suggestion for the Docker image name will be in the following format: `<prefix-value>/<your-service-name>`. The `prefix` property is required for this type and will replace `prefix-value`.

  - **prefix**: string that defines the prefix that will appear in the suggestion for the Docker image name. This property must be defined only when **type** property value is set to `CONSTANT_PREFIX`.

:::info
`<your-service-name>`, `<your-group-name>`, `<your-repo-name>`, are field values that you will decide during the [creation of a microservice](/development_suite/api-console/api-design/services.md#how-to-create-a-microservice-from-an-example-or-from-a-template). Some of these values must be defined in order to receive a suggestion for the Docker image name (depending on the suggestion **type**).
:::

- `enabledSecurityFeatures`: a set of features to enforce the security of the project. For further details, take a look at [the last section](#configure-security-features) of this page.
