A company is a resource that provides governance on all the projects it contains. 

Within a company, it is possible to:
- configure the infrastructure on which new projects will be based; 
- analyze the configuration of all existing projects;
- manage users and permissions.

#### SaaS
To create a new company in the Mia-Platform SaaS Console, open a [Service Request](https://makeitapp.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/21/group/79/create/340) and the company will be created for you.

#### On-Premise 
Before creating a new company in a Mia-Platform On-Premise Console installation, contact your Mia-Platform referent.

:::caution
Remember that the possibility of adding new companies may depend on the type of license you have subscribed to. 

Only a limited amount of companies may be available for creation within your license terms.
:::

Once you made sure you meet all the necessary requirements to create a new company, you can continue with this guide.

<br/>

The next steps will guide you through all the processes to create and correctly configure a new company.
 
### Requirements

To create and configure a company, you must have:

- access to the Console CMS (granted by the `console_cms` group)
- `Console Super User` role, or `console.root.company.create` permission

## Create a company from API

You can create a new company by making a POST request to the `/api/backend/companies` API. 

:::info
This API is visible inside the Console API Portal, under the `Companies` tag.
:::

You will be asked to set the **name** and the **description** of the company to add (only name is required). 

In addition, you will be added as the first Company user with the role of [`Company Owner`](/development_suite/identity-and-access-management/console-levels-and-permission-management.md#users-capabilities-inside-console).

##### Example call
```bash
curl 
  --request POST \ 
  --url https://{CONSOLE_HOST}/api/backend/companies \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```
where `CONSOLE_HOST` is the base path of your Console installation.

## Create a company from CMS

It is also possible to manually create a company from the Console CMS. 

However, you will lose some of the automation provided by the company creation API, such as adding the first user or providing a company unique identifier.

:::danger
It is recommended to use the API to create a new company. Use this method only if strictly necessary.
:::

<summary>Detailed guide</summary>

#### Create the company

Visit the Console CMS page and open the `Companies` section.

Click the `Add new` button, you will be asked to provide an **id**, a **name**, and a **description** for the company (only id and name are required). 

You will be able to set all the optional fields after the creation of the company.
For further information regarding other configuration fields, visit the dedicated [section](#default-configuration-for-a-new-project) later on this page.

#### Add the first Company User

Once your company has been created using CMS, you need to associate the first user to be able to access the company from the Console. 
The first user may either be yourself or another user on the Platform. 

Regardless, head over to the CMS page and click the `Bindings` menu item.

:::caution
Only a restricted set of users have access to the users' management section in CMS, contact your Console Administrator to obtain the right permissions to access this functionality.
:::

In the `Bindings` section, click the `Add new` button and fill in the form:
- type a custom **Binding ID**

:::danger
The _Binding ID_ must be unique in the whole collection!  

As a general recommendation, we suggest `{companyId}-{desiredRole}`, however in some cases, a more complex structure may be necessary.
:::

- select the proper **Role** (since it is the first user, it is recommended to set the role [`Company Owner`](/development_suite/identity-and-access-management/console-levels-and-permission-management.md#users-capabilities-inside-console))

- select the correct user as **Subject**

- assign the correct **Resource** by filling it with an object as follows:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "company",
  "resourceId": "{THE COMPANY ID YOU PROVIDED UPON CREATION}"
}
```

</details>

## Company Configuration

Once you create a company, you can configure:

- [clusters](/development_suite/clusters-management/clusters-overview-setup.md)
- [providers](/development_suite/set-up-infrastructure/configure-provider.mdx) (Git Providers, Secret Managers, CI/CD Tools)
- projects default configurations (such as environments, logical layers, and accessible namespaces)

:::info
Each of these configurations will be applied as the default configuration to newly created projects within the company.
:::

Let's now proceed with each step of the configuration:

### Connect a cluster

Clusters can be connected to a company from the **Clusters** section of the Console, inside the Company Overview area.

To connect a cluster, you can follow the [clusters connection guide](/development_suite/clusters-management/add-edit-remove-cluster.md).

### Configure Providers

Git Providers, Secret Managers, and CI/CD tools can be configured from the **Providers** section of the Console, inside the Company Overview area.

For further details on how to create new providers, you can follow the [providers configuration guide](/development_suite/set-up-infrastructure/configure-provider.mdx).

### Projects Default Configurations

By editing the company data model, you will be able to set default configurations for all the projects that will be created within the company.

:::info
This configuration can be done from the `Companies` section of the Console CMS.
:::

The projects default configurations fields are:

- **defaultTemplateId**:
  
  The identifier of the default template to be used for the creation of a project. 
  This information can be changed for a specific project during the steps of the project creation wizard.

- **cmsImageName**:
  
  The Docker image configuring the CMS used in your project. It should also contain the CMS tag to be used.
  This value will interpolate the template archive of your project.
  
  If `cms-site` service is disabled during the project creation, this field will not be used.

- **repository** (_required_):
  
  An object that specifies the information regarding the repository where the projects of this company will be created. 

  :::info
  This field can also be set by [selecting a default Git Provider](/development_suite/set-up-infrastructure/configure-provider.mdx#set-a-default-provider) in the **Providers** section of the Console.
  :::
  
  The object must have the following properties:

  - **providerId** (_required_): the unique identifier of the Git Provider associated with the company 
  
    It corresponds to the `providerId` field of the providers' CRUD collection, and it is used to retrieve information about the provider. 

    Check out the complete list of [supported providers](/development_suite/set-up-infrastructure/configure-provider.mdx);
  
  - **basePath**: the base path where the project will be created. 
    
    :::caution
    Make sure the selected Git Provider has the right permissions for creating projects on the configured path.
    :::

    Here are some tips on how to correctly configure the _basePath_ property, grouped by Git Provider:

    <Tabs>

    <TabItem value="gitlab" label="GitLab" default>

      It corresponds to the **basePath of the group** where to create the project.

      If the group does not exist, the project will be created only if the user has the needed permission to create the group in its parent.

      For example, if your group is reachable at the URL **`https://my-gitlab-host.eu/mia-platform/projects`**, <br/>
      then the `basePath` must be **`mia-platform/projects`**.
      
      If your group does not exist (in the example groupB):

      - /groupA/groupB -> if the user has permission to create groups in groupA, then groupB will be created;
      - /groupA/groupB -> if the user has no permission to create groups in groupA, then groupB will NOT be created;
      - /groupA/groupB -> if groupA does not exist, then it will NOT be created any group.

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="github" label="GitHub">

      It corresponds to the **path of an existing organization**. 
      
      If the path does not exist, the project will not be created.

      For example, if your organization is reachable at the URL **`https://github.com/mia-platform`**, <br/>
      then the `basePath` must be **`mia-platform`**

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="azure-devops" label="Azure DevOps">

      It corresponds to the **path where your Azure project is reachable**: the pattern is _company-name/project-name_.
      
      For example, if your project is reachable at the URL **`https://dev.azure.com/mia-platform-devops/Test`**, <br/>
      then the `basePath` must be **`mia-platform-devops/Test`**.

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="bitbucket" label="Bitbucket">

      It corresponds to the **path where your Bitbucket project is reachable**: the pattern is _projects/project-code_.

      For example, if your project is reachable at the URL **`https://bitbucket.mia-platform.eu/projects/Test`**, <br/>
      then the `basePath` must be **`projects/Test`**.

    </TabItem>

    </Tabs>
      
  - **visibility**: the visibility of the project. 

    Either one of the following:

      - `public`: the repository can be accessed and viewed by anyone, including non-authenticated users;
      - `internal`: the repository can be accessed and viewed by any authenticated user within the same Git Provider instance or organization;
      - `private`: the repository can only be accessed and viewed by users who have been explicitly granted access by the repository owner.

- **environmentsVariables**:
   
  An object that describes the configuration to enable the Variables section in the Project Settings area of the Console.

  :::info
  This field can also be set by [selecting a default Secret Manager](/development_suite/set-up-infrastructure/configure-provider.mdx#set-a-default-provider) in the **Providers** section of the Console.
  :::

  :::caution
  This field is not required. However, by leaving an empty configuration you will need to manually configure a Secret Manager for each project you create.
  :::

  The object can be configured with the following properties:

  - **providerId**: the unique identifier of the Secret Manager associated with the company. 
  
    It corresponds to the `providerId` field of the providers' CRUD collection, and it is used to retrieve information about the provider.

  This suggestion will appear in the `Docker Image Name` field when you [create a microservice](/development_suite/api-console/api-design/services.md#how-to-create-a-microservice-from-an-example-or-from-a-template).
  :::

  The object should have the following properties:

  - **type** (_required_): defines the format of the suggestion. 
    
    Currently, three types are present:

      - `PROJECT_ID` (_default_): **`<project-id>/<your-service-name>`**

        This is the default behavior, suggestions will follow this format when this field is not set. Do **not** set the _prefix_ property if you choose this type of suggestion.

      - `REPOSITORY`: **`<your-group-name>/<your-repo-name>`**

        Do **not** set the _prefix_ property if you choose this type of suggestion.

      - `CONSTANT_PREFIX`: **`<prefix-value>/<your-service-name>`**. 

        The _prefix_ property is required for this type and will replace _prefix-value_.

  - **prefix**: defines the prefix that will appear in the suggestion for the Docker image name. 
  
    This property must be defined only when **type** property value is set to `CONSTANT_PREFIX`.

  ##### Example Configuration
  ```json
  {
    "type": "CONSTANT_PREFIX",
    "prefix": "my-docker-image"
  }
  ```

- **imagePullSecretNames**:
  
  A list of imagePullSecret names. 
  
  :::note
  An imagePullSecret is a Kubernetes entity used to authenticate and authorize access to private container image registries. 
  :::

  The imagePullSecrets whose name is specified in this field will be inherited in the project during project creation and then used in deployment and cronjob files for pulling Docker images.

  ##### Example Configuration
  ```json
  [
    "my-imagepullsecret"
  ]
  ```

- **enabledSecurityFeatures**:
  
  A set of features to enforce the security of the project. 

  It defines the security features and settings that will be applied to the Kubernetes environment that your project will be deployed on.

  The object can be configured with the following properties:

  - **`seccompProfile`**: indicates whether the Seccomp profile is enabled. 
    
    Seccomp (short for secure computing mode) is a Linux kernel feature that restricts the system calls a process can make. Enabling Seccomp profiles helps enhance the security of containers by limiting their access to potentially dangerous system calls.

  - **`appArmor`**: indicates whether AppArmor is enabled. 
    
    AppArmor is a Linux security module that provides mandatory access control (MAC) policies. It allows you to define fine-grained restrictions on the actions that a process can perform, helping to prevent unauthorized activities and limit the potential impact of security breaches.

  - **`hostProperties`**: indicates whether the container has access to host properties. 
    
    Host properties typically include information about the underlying host system, such as network interfaces, file systems, or hardware details. Disabling access to host properties helps isolate the container from the host environment, reducing the risk of information leakage or unauthorized system access.

  - **`privilegedPod`**: indicates whether the container or pod has privileged access. 
    
    Privileged access means that the container or pod has elevated permissions and can perform privileged operations on the host system. Disabling privileged access is generally recommended for improved security, as it helps prevent containers from having unrestricted control over the underlying infrastructure.

  ##### Example Configuration
  ```json
  {
    "seccompProfile": false,
    "appArmor": false,
    "hostProperties": true,
    "privilegedPod": false
  }
  ```
