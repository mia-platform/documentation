# Design changes Fine-Grained Access Control

:::info
This feature is currently available exclusively as a **Closed Preview** and is not yet generally available. For more information and to request its activation for your Company, please contact your Mia-Platform referent.
:::

This feature introduces a mechanism for managing user interactions within the application by restricting specific actions based on user roles and specified rules in the Design section.

If a user attempts to save a configuration after performing some changes that are forbidden by the configured rules, the saving is blocked and an error is returned.

*Rules* and *user roles* can be configured at both the Project and the Company levels.
The following logic is applied:

- **Rules**: Project and Company rules are combined together without conflict, as only disallow rules are used.  
- **User Roles**: If a user has roles assigned at the Project level, only those roles used to find the applicable rules. If no Project-level roles are assigned, the roles defined at the Company level are used instead.

## Configuration definition

To enable this feature the `Project` or `Company` `configurationManagement.saveChangesRules` field of the configuration must be set with a list of objects with the following structure:

| Field               | Type        | Description                                   | Optional |
| ------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `disallowedRuleSet` | `RuleSet[]` | list of rules that prohibit a specific action | ❌       |
| `roleIds`           | `String[]`  | List of user roles to which the rules apply   | ❌       |

The `RuleSet` object has these fields:

| Field               | Type               | Description                                                     | Optional |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `jsonPath`          | `String`           | JSONPath of the resource on which the action must be prevented. | ✅       |
| `processingOptions` | `ProcessingOption` | Additional options of the rule                                  | ✅       |
| `ruleId`            | `String`           | Reference a to a rule from a predefined set                     | ✅       |

___
A `disallowedRuleSet` can be configured in 3 ways:

- [Via `jsonPath`](#via-jsonpath)
- [Via `jsonPath` and `processingOptions`](#via-jsonpath-and-processingoptions)
- [Via `ruleId`](#via-ruleid)

### Via `jsonPath`

The `jsonPath` field is used to extract a target resource applying a JSONPath expression on the JSON structure of the configuration. On the extracted resource are not permitted any updates.

### Via `jsonPath` and `processingOptions`

- The `jsonPath` is used to extract the target resource.
- The `processingOptions` define the `action` (`create`, `delete`) to prevent on the resource. If the resource captured by the jsonPath are of array type, the field `primaryKey` must be specified.

The `ProcessingOption` object has the following structure:

| Field        | Type       | Description                                                                                          | Optional |
| ------------ | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `action`     | `string[]` | Action to be prevented on the resource defined via the jsonPath. Possible values: `create`, `delete` | ❌       |
| `primaryKey` | `String`   | Primary key of the resource captured by the jsonPath. Mandatory if resource is of array type         | ✅       |

### Via `ruleId`

The `ruleId` references a rule from a predefined set of rules, that define a specific behavior.

**The available `ruleIds` are**:

| `ruleId`                  | Description                                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `endpoints.security.edit` | block edit of the fields [`public`, `acl`, `secreted`] of `endpoints` and `routes` inside endpoints |
|                           |                                                                                                     |

## Fetching and configuring rules with `miactl`

:::info
The following `miactl` commands will be introduced in version 0.16.0 of miactl, which is not yet released.
:::

```bash
miactl company rules list --company-id=my-company
miactl company rules list --company-id=my-company --project-id=my-project
miactl company rules update --company-id=my-company  -f ~/my-rules.json
miactl company rules update --company-id=my-company --project-id=my-project  -f ~/my-rules.json
```

Example for the file `my-rules.json`:

```json
[
 {
  "roleIds": ["developer"],
  "disallowedRuleSet": [
   {"ruleId": "endpoint.security.edit"}
  ]
 }
]
```

:::info
For the full specifications about the commands refer to the [related miactl documentation](/cli/miactl/30_commands.md)
