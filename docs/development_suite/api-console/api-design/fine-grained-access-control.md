# Fine-Grained Access Control in Design

:::info
This feature is currently available exclusively as a **Closed Preview** and is not yet generally available. For more information and to request its activation for your Company, please contact your Mia-Platform referent.
:::

This feature introduces a mechanism for managing user interactions within the application by restricting specific actions based on user roles and specified rules in the Design section.

If a user attempts to save a configuration after performing some changes that are forbidden by the configured rules, the saving is blocked and an error is returned.

*Rules* and *user roles* can be configured at both the Project and Company levels. The following logic applies:

**Rules:**  
Project and Company rules are evaluated together, supporting both "allow" and "disallow" types:

- **Allow rules (`allowedRuleSet`)**: If at least one allow rule is defined, only actions explicitly permitted by these rules are allowed; all others are denied.
- **Disallow rules (`disallowedRuleSet`)**: Only actions explicitly denied by these rules are blocked; all others are allowed.

Disallow rules are always evaluated first. If an action matches a disallow rule, it is denied immediately and allow rules are not checked.

**User Roles:**  
If a user has roles assigned at the Project level, only those roles are used to determine applicable rules. If no Project-level roles are assigned, the roles defined at the Company level are used instead.

## Configuration definition

To enable this feature the `Project` or `Company` `configurationManagement.saveChangesRules` field of the configuration must be set with a list of objects with the following structure:

| Field               | Type        | Description                                   | Optional |
| ------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `disallowedRuleSet` | `RuleSet[]` | list of rules that prohibit a specific action | See note |
| `allowedRuleSet`    | `RuleSet[]` | list of rules that allow a specific action    | See note |
| `roleIds`           | `String[]`  | List of user roles to which the rules apply   | ❌       |

> **Note:**  
> At least one of `disallowedRuleSet` or `allowedRuleSet` must be specified. You can provide either or both these fields.

The `RuleSet` object has these fields:

| Field               | Type               | Description                                                     | Optional |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `jsonPath`          | `String`           | JSONPath of the resource on which the action must be controlled.| ✅       |
| `processingOptions` | `ProcessingOption` | Additional options of the rule                                  | ✅       |
| `ruleId`            | `String`           | Reference to a rule from a predefined set                       | ✅       |

___
A `RuleSet` can be configured in 3 ways, and these apply to both `allowedRuleSet` and `disallowedRuleSet`:

- [Via `jsonPath`](#via-jsonpath)
- [Via `jsonPath` and `processingOptions`](#via-jsonpath-and-processingoptions)
- [Via `ruleId`](#via-ruleid)

### Via `jsonPath`

The `jsonPath` field is used to extract a target resource by applying a JSONPath expression on the JSON structure of the configuration. The rule will control (allow or disallow) any updates on the extracted resource, depending on whether it is in the `allowedRuleSet` or `disallowedRuleSet`.

### Via `jsonPath` and `processingOptions`

- The `jsonPath` is used to extract the target resource.
- The `processingOptions` define the `actions` (`create`, `delete`, or both) to allow or prevent on the resource. If the resource captured by the jsonPath is of array type, the field `primaryKey` must be specified.

The `ProcessingOption` object has the following structure:

| Field        | Type         | Description                                                                                              | Optional |
| ------------ | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `actions`    | `string[]`   | Actions to be controlled on the resource defined via the jsonPath. Possible values: `create`, `delete`. You can specify more than one action in the array. | ❌       |
| `primaryKey` | `String`     | Primary key of the resource captured by the jsonPath. Mandatory if resource is of array type             | ✅       |

> **Note:**  
> The `actions` field replaces the previous `action` field and must be an array. You can specify multiple actions to be controlled by the rule.

### Via `ruleId`

The `ruleId` references a rule from a predefined set of rules, that define a specific behavior.

**The available `ruleIds` are**:

| `ruleId`                  | Description                                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `endpoints.security.edit` | Controls edit of the fields [`public`, `acl`, `secreted`] of `endpoints` and `routes` inside endpoints |

## Examples of allow and disallow rules

The following examples illustrate how to configure both `allowedRuleSet` and `disallowedRuleSet` for common scenarios. Each example demonstrates how to explicitly allow or disallow specific actions for a given user role. You can use these examples as templates when defining your own rules in the configuration or when constructing the body of API requests (see [Configuring rules via API](#configuring-rules-via-api))

- **Control edit of the `dockerImage` of all services for the role `maintainer`**

*Disallow: prevent editing*

```json
{
  "configurationManagement": {
    "saveChangesRules": [
      {
        "disallowedRuleSet": [
          {
            "jsonPath": "$.services.*.dockerImage"
          }
        ],
        "roleIds": ["maintainer"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

*Allow: only allow editing*

```json
{
  "configurationManagement": {
    "saveChangesRules": [
      {
        "allowedRuleSet": [
          {
            "jsonPath": "$.services.*.dockerImage"
          }
        ],
        "roleIds": ["maintainer"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

- **Control creation and deletion of the resource `collections` for the role `maintainer`**

*Disallow: prevent creation and deletion*

```json
{
  "configurationManagement": {
    "saveChangesRules": [
      {
        "disallowedRuleSet": [
          {
            "jsonPath": "$.collections",
            "processingOptions": {
              "actions": ["create", "delete"]
            }
          }
        ],
        "roleIds": ["maintainer"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

*Allow: only allow creation and deletion*

```json
{
  "configurationManagement": {
    "saveChangesRules": [
      {
        "allowedRuleSet": [
          {
            "jsonPath": "$.collections",
            "processingOptions": {
              "actions": ["create", "delete"]
            }
          }
        ],
        "roleIds": ["maintainer"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

- **Control creation and deletion of services of a specific type (`custom-resource`) for the role `maintainer`**

*Disallow: prevent creation and deletion*

```json
{
  "configurationManagement": {
    "saveChangesRules": [
      {
        "disallowedRuleSet": [
          {
            "jsonPath": "$.services.[?(@.type==\"custom-resource\")]",
            "processingOptions": { "actions": ["create", "delete"] }
          }
        ],
        "roleIds": ["maintainer"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

*Allow: only allow creation and deletion*

```json
{
  "configurationManagement": {
    "saveChangesRules": [
      {
        "allowedRuleSet": [
          {
            "jsonPath": "$.services.[?(@.type==\"custom-resource\")]",
            "processingOptions": { "actions": ["create", "delete"] }
          }
        ],
        "roleIds": ["maintainer"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

- **Configure the predefined rule with `ruleId` "endpoints.security.edit" for the role `maintainer`**

*Disallow: prevent specified fields edit*

```json
{
  "configurationManagement": {
    "saveChangesRules": [
      {
        "disallowedRuleSet": [
          {
            "ruleId": "endpoints.security.edit"
          }
        ],
        "roleIds": ["maintainer"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

*Allow: only specified fields edit*

```json
{
  "configurationManagement": {
    "saveChangesRules": [
      {
        "allowedRuleSet": [
          {
            "ruleId": "endpoints.security.edit"
          }
        ],
        "roleIds": ["maintainer"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

> **Note:**  
> When using only `allowedRuleSet`, all actions are denied except those explicitly allowed.  
> When using only `disallowedRuleSet`, all actions are allowed except those explicitly disallowed.  
> If both are specified, disallow rules take precedence: if a disallow rule violation is found, allow rules are not evaluated for that action.

## Fetching and configuring rules with `miactl`

:::tip
The following commands are available from [miactl v0.16.0](https://github.com/mia-platform/miactl/releases/tag/v0.16.0), make sure you upgrade.

For the full command specification, please refer to the [related miactl documentation](/cli/miactl/30_commands.md#rules).
:::

Command examples:

```bash
miactl company rules list --company-id=my-company
miactl company rules list --company-id=my-company --project-id=my-project
miactl company rules update --company-id=my-company  -f ~/my-rules.json
miactl company rules update --company-id=my-company --project-id=my-project  -f ~/my-rules.json
```

Example for the file `my-rules.json`:

```json
[
 {
  "roleIds": ["developer"],
  "disallowedRuleSet": [
   {"ruleId": "endpoint.security.edit"}
  ]
 }
]
```
