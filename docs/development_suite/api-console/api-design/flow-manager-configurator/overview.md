## Link

Each Flow Manager service can be manually linked at any time, this allows the usage of the Flow Manager Configurator in order to build the service configuration.

:::info
Once the Flow Manager service is linked, a commit is required in order to properly handle the service configuration. After the commit, indeed, the config map of the Flow Manager service will no longer be editable as it is completely controlled by the Configurator tool.
:::

There are some cases in which the Flow Manager service cannot be linked to the Configurator, those cases are:
- missing environment variable `CONFIGURATIONS_FILE_PATH`
- wrong `CONFIGURATIONS_FILE_PATH` value
- missing config map
- invalid config map content (does not match JSON schema)

For each of these cases the Configurator will show an error with a badge describing the error.

## Unlink

Each linked Flow Manager service can be manually unlinked at any time, without losing any previously saved configuration.

:::warning
Unlinking a flow with unsaved changes will cause the loss of those changes.
:::

:::info
As per the link process, a commit is required to regain access to the JSON configuration.
