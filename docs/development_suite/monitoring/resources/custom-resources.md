If deployed, the information on the [Custom Resources](/console/design-your-projects/custom-resources/custom-resources.md) for the project can be accessed in the section `Custom Resources` of the sidebar in the `Runtime`section.

:::caution
If you created one or more Custom Kubernetes Resource from a marketplace template **prior** to Console release v13.3.0, the resources **will not be visible by default**. 

Please ensure to [update your resource](/marketplace/add_to_marketplace/add_item_by_type/add_custom_resource.md#update-a-custom-resource-to-the-console-v1330) version via [miactl](/cli/miactl/10_overview.md) to one that has the properties `resourceId` and `type` correctly set in the `runtime` object field of its definition, otherwise the Custom Kubernetes Resources won't be visible in the section even if the resource is active.
