In Kubernetes, a [Job](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/) is the resource that creates one or more Pods and will continue to retry execution of the Pods until a specified number of them successfully terminate.

On this section you can monitor all your Jobs and the relative properties.

## Jobs Table

The table presented here shows the following information:

- **Name**: the name of the Job.
- **Finished Pods**: the number of succeeded Pods out of all the Pods that have been created. For more info check the [kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/workload-resources/job-v1/#JobStatus).
- **Duration**: the time when the Job was completed.
- **Age**: the date when the Job was lastly deployed.

## Deleting a Job

:::info

This feature is only available to users with sufficient permissions. For more information, consult the [Console Levels and Permission Management](/development_suite/identity-and-access-management/console-levels-and-permission-management.md) section of the docs.

:::

By clicking on the **Delete button** on the last column of the Job table, the Job will be permanently deleted.

A modal will ask for confirmation for the action to be performed.

Any related resources, such as Pods, will be marked for deletion, and Kubernetes may [cascading delete](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/garbage-collection/#cascading-deletion) them at any time.

:::warning

The deletion is permanent, therefore make sure to save elsewhere any important information before deleting a Job.
Please note that also the related Pod(s) are marked for deletion, along with their information such as logs.

## Inspecting a Job

By clicking on the Job name you can inspect some details about the Job.

### Job Describe

In the `Describe` view you can find information about the selected Job in JSON format.
These details are the ones exposed by the [Kubernetes APIs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/workload-resources/job-v1).
