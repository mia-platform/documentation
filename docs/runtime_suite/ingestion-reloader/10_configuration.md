The Ingestion Reloader is one of the Bucket Storage Support components. It is responsible for publishing
on a specified topic one or more events that were previously stored on an external bucket (usually this is achieved via consumed [Ingestion Storer](../../fast_data/bucket_storage_support/configuration/ingestion_storer_configuration) plugin).

To learn more about the plugin and its configuration, please navigate to its [documentation](../../fast_data/bucket_storage_support/configuration/ingestion_reloader_configuration) in the Fast Data section.
