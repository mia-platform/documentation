This sections illustrates how to use the SMS Service.

## POST /send

With this API you can send a new SMS.

### Body

The body of the request should have the following shape.

- `sender` (required): the sender of the message. It can be one of the following:
  - a phone number in [E.164][e164] format
  - an [alphanumeric sender ID][twilio-sender-id]

- `receiver` (required): the destination phone number in [E.164][e164] format.

- `body` (required): the text of the SMS you want to send.

:::caution
The body of a single SMS can be up to **1600 characters** long. If it's longer than that, the service will send the 
message as a segmented SMS and your Twilio account will be charged accordingly.
:::

It follows an example of a valid request body.

```json
{
  "sender": "+15017122661",
  "receiver": "+15558675310",
  "body": "Your SMS body"
}
```

### Response

#### Exceptions

If something goes wrong during the request, the response will have a `4xx` or `5xx` status code and the following
payload:

```json
{
  "statusCode": "400",
  "error": "Bad request",
  "message": "Exception description"
}
```

A notable status code is **429**, which means that you have reached the REST API concurrency limit of Twilio (more
information [here][twilio-rate-limits]).

#### Success

In case of successful response (status code `200`), the body of the response has the following structure:

```json
{
  "dateEvent": "2021-08-13T12:53:52.959Z", // ISO format
  "numSegments": "1", // Number of SMS messages it took to deliver the body of the message
  "sid": "124354", // Unique identifier of the SMS
  "status": "sent"
}
```
