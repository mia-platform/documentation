## Introduction
The `Identification Manager` application allow you to set up all the steps needed to implements and manage different identification processes inside a single flow. 

In particular, the main functionalities delivered with this application are the following:
1. define and add new custom identification processes
2. dynamically choose the identification process to use based on custom rules
3. provide an unified data schema with the information extracted from different identifications services or external providers
4. support of multitenants configuration

## How it works
With the elements available in the [marketplace](../../marketplace/overview_marketplace) it is possible to define a set of different identification processes, each of them with their custom identification steps, in particular:
1. Leveraging the flexibility of the [flow manager service](../../runtime_suite/flow-manager-service/overview) you can define:
    - the `main flow` contains the commons steps between all the identifications processes, e.g. creation of a verifiable credential, in particular:
        - there are only one `main flow` inside the application
        - the post identification steps are customizable
        - the extracted data from the identification process are available in a standard format
    - the `sub flow` contains all the steps for a specific identification process, in particular:
        - there is no limit on the number of `sub flow` managed by the application
        - the identification steps are all customizable
        - the extracted data are both saved in the raw and standard format
        - the `sub flow` directly interact with the identification service

2. some plugins provides a ready to use integration with some identification services
3. with the identification adapter template you can speed up the implementation of your custom integration
4. the `identification router plugin` allow you can define custom rules to manage dynamically the comunication between an external services (e.g. an identification service, backend for frontend etc...) and the right `sub flow`
5. with the `verifiable credential generator` template you can speed up the implementation of your custom service for the generation of the verifiable credential at the end of the identification process


## Standard Data Schema
The identification data extracted during the identification process are stored in a uniform data schema.
The identification services are in charge to map the data retrieved in the different identification step to the right format. 

The standard data schema is describe below:
```json5

    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "externalId": { "type": "string"},
        "tenantId": { "type": "string"},
