In the following document we will provide some example flows for a generic Payment Provider, called `provider`.
Provider specific edge cases are covered in more detail in the following pages, this is more of a generic overview of
the **Payment Gateway Manager** and how to interact with it.

The **Payment Gateway Manager** interfaces aim to be agnostic to the payment provider used.
Some providers may require additional fields, in which case they will be wrapped in a single, optional object field.

## Core Concepts

### Identifiers
- **PaymentId**: unique identifier of the payment provided by the `provider`
- **ShopTransactionId**: unique identifier of the payment on the user's system
- **SubscriptionToken**: unique identifier of the subscription provided by the `provider`

### Amount and Currency
The `amount` is expressed as an integer in order to avoid precision loss.
Together with the `currency` value (ISO 4217) the correct float value can be computed. 

:::warning
Only "EUR" currency is supported at this moment
:::


## Payment

`POST /{provider}/{payment-method}/pay`

Perform a payment on the `provider` with the `payment-method` chosen.

#### Request
```jsonc
{
    "amount": 500,                                     // the amount to be paid
    "currency": "EUR",                               // currency used for the payment
    "shopTransactionId": "123456789",                // the unique id of your transaction
    "successRedirectUrl": "http://example.com/ok",   // the URL to be redirected to if payment succeeds (optional)
    "failureRedirectUrl": "http://example.com/ko",   // the URL to be redirected to if payment fails (optional)
    "providerData": {...}                            // the object with provider-specific data (optional, varies with the provider)
}
```

For more information about the content of the `providerData` object, read the page related to the chosen provider.

#### Response

```jsonc
{
    "result": "OK",                                                  // transaction result
    "resultDescription": "Transaction Completed",                    // human readable transaction result (varies with the provider)
    "paymentId": "payment-123456789",                                // payment transaction id as returned by the provider
    "redirectToUrl": "https://provider-redirect-url.com",            // redirect web page
    "redirectToUrlMobile": "provider-app://redirect?token=example"   // redirect iOS url-scheme, used to open the provider's app in iOS devices
}
```
The **result** field can have the following values:
- **OK**: the transaction has been performed successfully on the `provider`;
- **KO**: the transaction has been rejected by the `provider`;
- **PENDING**: the transaction is pending; an asynchronous notification will arrive from the `provider` with the information about the status of the transaction;
- **REDIRECT_TO_URL**: the transaction is pending and needs further actions by the user in order to be completed; in this case at least one of the following fields is available:
    - **redirectToUrl**: redirect to a web page
    - **redirectToUrlMobile**: redirect iOS url-scheme, used to open the provider's app in iOS devices

## Refund

`POST /{provider}/refund`

Perform a refund for a transaction on the `provider`.

#### Request

```jsonc
{
    "amount": 500,
    "currency": "EUR",
    "paymentId": "123456789",
    "providerData": {...}   // the object with provider-specific data (optional, varies with the provider)
}
```

#### Response

```jsonc
{
    "result": "OK"
}
```
The **result** field can have the following values:
- **OK**: the refund has been performed successfully on the `provider`;
- **KO**: the refund has been rejected by the `provider`;
- **PENDING**: the refund is pending; an asynchronous notification will arrive from the `provider` with the information about the status of the transaction;

## Subscriptions

The **Payment Gateway Manager** can interact with the `provider` in order to manage subscriptions, that are *recurrent payments*.

A *recurrent payment* is a payment strategy that splits a whole payment across multiple installments,
whose only the first one requires an interaction with the client (its authorization).
An example of such payment strategy is paying monthly for a season ticket that covers one year.

Using an enabled provider, a client executes an initial payment where they also authorize the underlying
system to perform future payments on their behalf, using the same details of the initial payment.
This grant is defined through a token generated by the payments provider once the initial payment
is successfully completed and returned to the payment system.

The following actions are available:
- **schedule**: the `provider` will automatically handle new recurring payments and send a notification when the status of a subscription changes
- **manually**:
  - **start**: create a new subscription on the `provider`
  - **pay**: perform a new payment related to an already created subscription on the `provider`
- **update**: update information related to the subscription
- **get status**: get the subscription status
- **expire**: expire a subscription

An object `subscriptionInfo` needs to be included in the request in order to specify information about the subscription. 
```jsonc
{
    "subscriptionInfo": {
        "token": "0987654321",         // unique id of the subscription
        "interval": "DAY",             // time unit
        "intervalCount": 1,            // frequency of the subscription
        "expiresAfter": 1              // maximum number of payments for the subscription (optional)
    }
}
```
The following values are accepted for the field **interval**:
- **DAY**
- **MONTH**

:::warning
Each provider can accept only some **interval** values
:::

On the response a **SubscriptionToken** is returned, that is the identifier to use in order to perform action on the correct subscription.


### Schedule
`POST /{provider}/{payment-method}/subscription/schedule`

Create a new subscription managed entirely by the `provider`.
The `provider` will notify with a callback every change on the subscription.

#### Request

```jsonc
{
    "amount": 200,                     // the amount to be paid at each recurrent payment
    "currency": "EUR",                 // currency to use
    "shopTransactionId": "1234567890", // the unique id of your transaction
    "subscriptionInfo": {
        "interval": "DAY",             // time unit
        "intervalCount": 1,            // frequency of the subscription
        "expiresAfter": 1              // maximum number of payments for the subscription (optional)
    },
    "providerData": {...}              // the object with provider-specific data (optional, varies with the provider)
}
```
Possible values of `subscrptionInfo.interval` are:
- DAY
- WEEK
- MONTH
- YEAR

### Get Status
`GET /{provider}/subscription/status/{subscriptionToken}`

Get the subscription status. Available status are:
- `PENDING`: first payment to be executed
- `ACTIVE`: last payment executed
- `PAST_DUE`: last payment failed
- `EXPIRED`: the subscription has reached the expiration date
- `CANCELED`: the subscription has been manually canceled
- `UNKNOWN`: the subscription status is unknown

:::note
The actual available status depend on the provider. It is always a subset of the list above.
For more information visit the provider dedicated documentation page.
:::

#### Response

```jsonc
{
    "status": "ACTIVE",
    "subscriptionToken": "098764321",
    "providerName": "stripe",
    "metadata": {...} 
}
```

### Expire
`DELETE /{provider}/subscription/expire/{subscriptionToken}`

Expire the subscription on the `provider`.

## Pay By Link
The **Payment Gateway Manager** is also able to handle the Pay By Link scenario, it requests the link to the provider and returns it. 
The user can simply click on the link and will be redirected to the provider specific payment page, with all the payment methods enabled through the dashboard of that provider. 
At the end of the process the PGM will receive a callback that notifies about the payment result. 

`POST /{provider}/pay-by-link`

#### Request
```jsonc
{
    "amount": 500,                                     // the amount to be paid
    "currency": "EUR",                               // currency used for the payment
    "shopTransactionId": "123456789",                // the unique id of your transaction
    "successRedirectUrl": "http://example.com/ok",   // the URL to be redirected to if payment succeeds (optional)
    "failureRedirectUrl": "http://example.com/ko",   // the URL to be redirected to if payment fails (optional)
    "providerData": {...}                            // the object with provider-specific data (optional, varies with the provider)
}
```

#### Response

```jsonc
{
    "resultCode": "OK",                              // transaction result
    "resultDescription": "Transaction Completed",    // human readable transaction result (varies with the provider)
    "paymentId": "payment-123456789",                // payment transaction id as returned by the provider (optional)
    "link": "https://provider-redirect-url.com",     // the created link
}
```

The **result** field can have the following values:
- **OK**: the link has been created successfully by the `provider`;
- **KO**: the link has not been created by the `provider`;

## Payment Status

The payment status is available through many endpoints with the following format: 
```json
{
  "status": "ACCEPTED",
  "paymentId": "1234567890",
  "shopTransactionId": "0987654321",
  "providerName": "PROVIDER_NAME",
  "paymentMethod": "PAYMENT_METHOD",
  "action": "PAYMENT",
  "metadata": {...}
}
```

The **result** field can have the following values:
- **ACCEPTED**: the transaction has been performed successfully on the `provider`;
- **FAILED**: the transaction has been rejected by the `provider`;
- **PENDING**: the transaction is pending;

The **action** field can have the following values:
- **PAYMENT**: the status refers to a payment;
- **REFUND**: the status refers to a refund;

The **metadata** field is optional and can contain additional information.

### Status

`GET /{provider}/status?paymentId=0987654321`

Retrieve [payment status](#payment-status).


### Check

`GET /{provider}/check?paymentId=0987654321`

The **Payment Gateway Manager** sends a callback with the status of the payment to an external service, as specified by the
`PAYMENT_CALLBACK_URL` environment variable.
More details on how to configure the callback are available on the dedicated section.


## M2M Callback Transaction Verification
`GET /{provider}/callback`

`POST /{provider}/callback`

When the transaction result is known by the `generic-provider`, the latter may notify the **Payment Gateway Manager**.

This call will contain information allowing to identify the transaction.

The **Payment Gateway Manager** can use this information to check the transaction status, depending on the provider.

Once the check has been performed, the Payment Gateway Manager can notify the result to an external service, as specified by the 
`PAYMENT_CALLBACK_URL` environment variable.

The notification include the payment status as described [above](#payment-status).


## Utility 

The **Payment Gateway Manager** exposes utility APIs for some providers.
These APIs abstract the boundary operations and allow the developer to focus on the payment process itself, rather than the configuration processes.
Check the provider page in order to find which utility APIs are available. 

## External Integration

The **Payment Gateway Manager** supports payment through custom external integrations.
In this way, new payment methods can be integrated independently and the functionality of the **Payment Gateway Manager** can be extended with custom integrations.
API calls to these endpoints will be redirected to external microservices where payment management logic will be implemented.
Below, the interface exposed: 

* Payment Request: `POST /{external}/pay`
* Refund Request: `POST /{external}/refund`
* Manage Subscriptions:
    * Schedule a new Subscription: `POST /{external}/subscription/schedule`
    * Start *manually* a new Subscription: `POST /{external}/subscription/start`
    * Perform *manually* a payment related to a Subscription: `POST /{external}/subscription/pay`
    * Update a Subscription: `POST /{external}/subscription/update/{subscriptionToken}`
    * Expire a Subscription: `DELETE /{external}/subscription/expire/{subscriptionToken}`
* Get status of a Transaction: `POST /{external}/status`
* M2M Callback Transaction Status Verification: `GET /{external}/callback`
* On-Demand Transaction Status Verification: `GET /{external}/check`

More details about custom external integrations are available on the [dedicated section](30_payment_providers/99_external.md).

## Payment Saga APIs - Flow Manager Integration

The **Payment Gateway Manager** is able to communicate with Flow Manager service via REST APIs by sending events and exposing a dedicated interface:
* Payment Request: `POST /saga/pay`
* Refund Request: `POST /saga/refund`
* Manage Subscriptions:
    * Schedule a new Subscription: `POST /saga/subscription/schedule`
    * Start *manually* a new Subscription: `POST /saga/subscription/start`
    * Perform *manually* a payment related to a Subscription: `POST /saga/subscription/pay`

More details about flow manager integrations are available on the [dedicated section](./40_flow_manager_integration.md).

## Documentation

You can view the Swagger compatible OpenAPI documentation by calling the `/documentation` endpoint.
You can also use `/documentation/openapi.json` as the documentation endpoint in the microservice configuration to add it
to the API Portal.

## Metrics
