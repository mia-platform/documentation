## Endpoints

Every Soisy endpoint has this prefix path `/v3/soisy`.

### Pay

`POST /{payment-method}/pay`

This endpoint allows to execute payments via the Soisy payment provider.

The request body may have the `providerData` structured as follows (no field is required):
- `email`
- `firstname`
- `lastname`
- `instalments` (integer)
- `vatId`
- `vatCountry`
- `fiscalCode`
- `mobilePhone`
- `city`
- `province`
- `address`
- `civicNumber`
- `postalCode`
- `zeroInterestRate` (boolean)

The payment response can only have the **REDIRECT_TO_URL** result code: the payment creation was successful (the buyer
should be redirected to complete the payment).


### Status

`GET /status?paymentId={paymentId}`

This endpoint allows to get the current status of the payment identified by the **required** query parameter `paymentId`.

#### Mapping
The status received by the provider will be mapped according to the following table:

| Provider Status          | Plugin Status |
|--------------------------|---------------|
| DISBURSED                | ACCEPTED      |
| CANCELED                 | FAILED        |
| QUOTE                    | PENDING       |
| REQUEST_APPROVED         | PENDING       |
| REQUEST_RECEIVED         | PENDING       |
| WAITING_FOR_VERIFICATION | PENDING       |
| WAITING_FOR_DISBURSEMENT | PENDING       |

Everything else will be mapped as FAILED.

### Check

`GET /check?paymentId={paymentId}`

This endpoint allows to get the current status of the payment identified by the **required** query parameter `paymentId` and also send a notification to the external service as specified by `PAYMENT_CALLBACK_URL` environment variable.


### Callback

`POST /callback`

This endpoint should only be called by Soisy.
