## Endpoints

Every Scalapay endpoint has this prefix path `/v3/scalapay`

### Pay

`POST /{payment-method}/pay`

This endpoint allows to execute payments via the Scalapay payment provider.

The request body requires the `providerData` field which requires the following data:
```jsonc
{
  {
        "consumer": {
            "givenNames": "name",
            "surname": "surname"
        },
        "shipping": {
            "countryCode": "IT",
            "name": "shipping name",
            "postcode": "20800",
            "line1": "Via Garibaldi, 12"
        },
        "items": [{
            "quantity": 1,
            "price": {
                "amount": 100,
                "currency": "EUR"
            },
            "name": "item name",
            "category": "category name",
            "sku": "sku value"
        }],
        "travelDate": "01-01-1999"
    }
}
```

The payment response can have the following result codes:
- **REDIRECT_TO_URL**: the payment creation was successful (the buyer should be redirected to authorize the payment) 
- **KO**: the payment creation failed

### Refund

`POST /refund`
This endpoint allows to refund an already executed payment via the Scalapay provider.

The request body does not require any provider-specific data.

### Status

`GET /status?paymentId={paymentId}`

This endpoint allows to get the current status of the payment identified by the **required** query parameter `paymentId`.

#### Mapping
The status received by the provider will be mapped according to the following table:

| Provider Status | Plugin Status |
|-----------------|---------------|
| charged         | ACCEPTED      |
| refunded        | FAILED        |
| expired         | FAILED        |
| created         | PENDING       |
| pending         | PENDING       |
| authorized      | PENDING       |
| approved        | PENDING       |

Everything else will be mapped as PENDING.

### Check

`GET /check?paymentId={paymentId}`

This endpoint allows to get the current status of the payment identified by the **required** query parameter `paymentId` and also send a notification to the external service as specified by `PAYMENT_CALLBACK_URL` environment variable.


### Callback

`POST /callback`

This endpoint should only be called by Scalapay.
