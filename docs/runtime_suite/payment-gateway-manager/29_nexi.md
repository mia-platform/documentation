## Endpoints

Every Nexi endpoint has this prefix path `/v3/nexi`

### Pay

`POST /{payment-method}/pay`

This endpoint allows to execute payments via the Nexi payment provider.

You can always define the following optional fields in `providerData`:
```jsonc
{
  [...]
  "providerData": {
    "language": "string",       // ISO 639-2
    "expirationDate": "string", // format YYYY-MM-DD
  }
}
```

The payment response can have the following result codes:
- **REDIRECT_TO_URL**: the payment was successfully submitted
- **KO**: the payment failed

### Check

`GET /check?paymentId={paymentId}`

This endpoint should only be called by Nexi.
