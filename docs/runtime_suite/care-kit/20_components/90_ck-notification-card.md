![ck-notification-card]()

## Usage

Properties `clusterLabel` and `clusterIcon` will be shown in the card header. `clusterIcon` is contained the name of the card icon it should be the name of one of the `fontawesome` icons like `FaChartLine`.
Property `topics` will be the list of available events inside each card, it is contained 
```
{ 
  eventName: 'name',
  labels: {
    en: 'Name',
    it: 'Nome'
  }
}

After the clusters have been retrieved, the available and enabled channels will be displayed on each category upon initialization. Every time a channel is selected a request contained the new enabled channels for the user will be sent to the `/user-notification-settings/` endpoint, and the list will updated based on the new list.
