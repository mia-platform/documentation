## [1.0.1] - 2023-12-19

### Fixed

- when an ingestion event representing a `DELETE` operation is processed, in case it is not possible to extract the `before`
property from the message itself, the service tries to retrieve it from the storage system. In case it does not find it,
the `before` property of the `DELETE` operation is then set to the projection record's key as fallback.
- when employing `custom` message adapter, when an empty payload is received, it ensured that a buffer of zero length is
sent to the user-defined implementation. In this manner, they can design their own logic to properly treat such cases.

### Changed

- service dependencies were updated
- unused error codes were removed
