The **Pharma Ecommerce Backend** is a Mia-Platform plugin that provides APIs that can be used to create your own pharmaceutical e-commerce.

It allows through its endpoints to:

- sign up users to the pharma e-commerce providers;
- get the providers available in a given location;
- get a list of product categories available for a specific provider in a given location;
- get a list of products or a specific product detail for a specific provider and a specific location;
- create a shopping cart for a logged user and manage its items with items addition, update and delete;
- create an order for the logged user from it's current shopping cart;
- access the orders' history of the currently logged user.

The available functionalities are detailed in the [usage section](./30_usage.md) of the documentation.

:::info
At the moment, the **Pharma Ecommerce Backend** supports only [PharmaPrime](https://www.pharmaprime.it/) as pharma e-commerce provider. Additional providers may be added in the future.
