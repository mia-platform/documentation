## [3.1.4] 2023-12-15

### Fixed

- improve description of `FD_SVTG_E0003` error code

## [3.1.3] 2023-11-03

### Added

- Added Single View name to the sv-trigger message

### Changed

- updated Docker image to employ NodeJS v20

### Fixed

- `__internal_kafka_info` property can now correctly accepts `number` type as key value when pr-updates `v1.0.0` are read.

## [3.1.2] 2023-10-10

### Fixed

- review support of custom CA certificate for Kafka Producer client

## [3.1.1] 2023-10-02

### Added

- message header to `sv-trigger` events to specify which schema it is employed

### Changed

- upgraded `fast-data-automation-lib` to `v3.1.3` to fix an issue on `pr-update` events with `after` property in message payload set to `null`
- updated development demo to test service functioning with multiple projections
- updated definition of `__internal__kafkaInfo` in `pr-update` event to avoid conflicts with types

## [3.1.0] 2023-09-25

### Added

- add support for `v2.0.0` of pr-update 

### Changed

- update NodeJS version to `v18.18.0`

## [3.0.4] 2023-09-22

### Added

- Added check on foreign keys to know if running strategy on both before and after is necessary

### Changed

- upgraded `fast-data-automation-lib` to `v3.1.2`
- remove unused environment variables `READ_TOPIC_FROM_BEGINNING` and `CA_CERT_PATH`. Their actual configuration can be found within the event store config file
- update NodeJS version to `v18.17.1`
- updated library dependencies

### Fixed

- additional CA files can be added to the `ssl` config of the event store
- removed printing invalid event store configuration to avoid sharing sensitive information

## [3.0.3] 2023-07-25

### Added

- added new metrics to monitor Kafka consumer that reads from pr-update topics
- added a docker-compose file and an example of configuration, which allows to automatically configure a demo of the Single View Trigger Generator
- added a Makefile to simplify the interaction with docker-compose and starting tests using dependencies defined in the docker-compose

### Changed

- updated `fast-data-automation-lib` to `v3.1.1`
- updated service dependencies

## [3.0.2] 2023-06-30

### Fixed

- Kafka log level is mapped to the kafkajs string, not number

## [3.0.1] 2023-06-27

### Fixed

- Kafka brokers is a comma separated string, not an array of strings

## [3.0.0] 2023-06-27

### Added

- Added support for the generation of MongoDB projection changes instead of `sv-trigger` kafka messages

### Breaking Changes

- kafkaProjectionChanges configMap does not support `__lookup__` strategy type anymore since `pr-updates` events for `PATCH` operations are supported also by the Single View Creator
- consequently, the service won't emit `sv-trigger` messages of type `patch`, in fact the property `type` has been removed from `sv-trigger` messages altogether 
- kafka configuration is not passed through environment variables but through its own config map [`Input Output Config`](../docs/fast_data/configuration/single_view_trigger_generator#input-output-config)
- `TRIGGER_TOPIC` environment variable has been generalized and renamed to `EVENT_STORE_TARGET` to have meaning also with mongo collections 

## [2.0.1] 2023-04-14

### Changed

- review error codes to be aligned with the troubleshooting guidelines

## [2.0.0] 2023-04-13

### Breaking Changes

- environmental variables
  - renamed `STRATEGIES_FOLDER` into `MANUAL_STRATEGIES_FOLDER` 
  - renamed `CUSTOM_FUNCTIONS_FOLDER` into `TRIGGER_CUSTOM_FUNCTIONS_FOLDER`
  - removed `USE_AUTOMATIC`
  - `SINGLE_VIEW_NAME`, `ER_SCHEMA_FOLDER`, `PROJECTION_CHANGES_SCHEMA_FOLDER` are now always required
- manual and custom strategy functions are expected to be AsyncGenerator of `IdentifierObject` instead of
returning a Promise containing a list of `IdentifierObject`

### Added

- added support to MongoDB v6.0

### Changed

- upgraded service dependencies, among which the most relevant are
  - `@mia-platform-internal/fast-data-automation-lib@v3`
  - `mongodb@v5`
- removed dependencies not needed anymore
- refactored the service to use Mia eslint standard
- simplified the process of configurations loading removing unnecessary repetition or use cases management
- expanded tests
- refactored how the core logic and service dependencies are composed, removing the need of `fastify-pluging`
- swapped ts-node with swc for transpling tests source code
- upgraded Docker image to node v18.15.0
- reviewed pipeline removing unneeded packages installation
- reduced the size of the trigger message buffer from 500 to 100 to prevent issues with JS garbage collector

### Removed

- removed support to MongoDB v4.0

## [1.0.1] 2023-02-24

### Changed

- Added env var `READ_TOPIC_FROM_BEGINNING` to read `pr-update` messages topic from the beginning
- Readiness route working, improve on handling of kafka consumer heartbeat, faster service start up by removing `await` on `consumer.run`

## [1.0.0] 2023-01-20

### Breaking Change

## [0.3.2] 2022-12-20

## [0.3.1] 2022-11-29

## [0.1.0] 2022-11-03

### Added

- Added the strategy execution time metric
- Added the health routes (health, ready, check-up)

### Changed

- updated `getStrategyFunctionFromAutomatic` inside `getStrategies` to support the new automator function with `UpdateEvent` as parameter
