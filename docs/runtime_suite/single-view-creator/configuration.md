This service allows you to update the Single View when a new projection change occurs.

It requires MongoDB and Kafka to be installed in your platform. The former is used to read the projections changes and update the Single View, the latest is used to notify the events happening, like a Single View creation.  

:::info
If you want to write your own code for your Single View Creator service we suggest you to start from our [Single View Creator Template](../../fast_data/configuration/single_view_creator/template.md) which contains several utilities that can help you.

To learn more about the Single View Creator and its configuration, you can read [its documentation in the Fast Data area](../../fast_data/architecture.md#single-view-creator-svc).
