The Jira source supports to take events from Jira using the Jira Webhook.

## Webhook Integration

The Jira source integrates with webhooks by exposing an endpoint at `/jira/webhook`.
When a webhook event is received, the following steps are performed:

1. **Validation**: The request is validated using the secret passed by the Webhook.
1. **Event Handling**: The event type is extracted from the payload and the corresponding event is sent to the pipeline.
From the event type, it is also set which operation use: `Write` or `Delete` operation are supported by the sink.

### Service Configuration

The following configuration options are supported by the Jira source:

- **type** (*string*): The type of the source, in this case `jira`
- **authentication** (*object*) *optional*: The authentication configuration
  - **secret** ([*SecretSource*](../20_install.md#secretsource)): The secret used to validate the incoming webhook requests
- **webhookPath** (*string*) *optional*: The path where to receive the webhook events. Default to `/jira/webhook`.

#### Example

```json
{
  "type": "jira",
  "webhookPath": "/webhook",
  "authentication": {
    "secret": {
      "fromEnv": "JIRA_SECRET"
    }
  }
}
```

### How to Configure Jira

To configure a webhook in Jira, follow the steps described in [this documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/webhooks/).

As fields, you should set:

- **Name**: a name which identify the Webhook;
- **URL**: the URL where the Webhook will send the events. For the Jira integration, the URL should be `http://<your-agent-host>[/optional-base-path]/jira/webhook`;
- **Secret**: the secret used to validate the incoming webhook requests. This secret should be the same
as the one set in the authentication configuration.

## Supported Events

The Jira source supports the following webhook events:

| Event                 | Event Type                 | Example Payload                               | Operation |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|
|  issue created        | `jira:issue_created`       | [link](#issue-event-payload)                  | Write     |
|  issue updated        | `jira:issue_updated`       | [link](#issue-event-payload)                  | Write     |
|  issue deleted        | `jira:issue_deleted`       | [link](#issue-event-payload)                  | Delete    |
|  issue link created   | `issuelink_created`        | [link](#issue-link-event-payload)             | Write     |
|  issue link deleted   | `issuelink_deleted`        | [link](#issue-link-event-payload)             | Delete    |
|  project created      | `project_created`          | [link](#project-event-payload)                | Write     |
|  project updated      | `project_updated`          | [link](#project-event-payload)                | Write     |
|  project deleted      | `project_deleted`          | [link](#project-event-payload)                | Delete    |
|  project soft deleted | `project_soft_deleted`     | [link](#project-event-payload)                | Delete    |
|  project restore      | `project_restored_deleted` | [link](#project-event-payload)                | Write     |
|  version created      | `jira:version_created`     | [link](#project-version-event-payload)        | Write     |
|  version updated      | `jira:version_updated`     | [link](#project-version-event-payload)        | Write     |
|  version deleted      | `jira:version_deleted`     | [link](#project-version-event-payload)        | Deleted   |
|  version merged       | `jira:version_deleted`     | [link](#project-version-merged-event-payload) | Deleted   |
|  version released     | `jira:version_released`    | [link](#project-version-event-payload)        | Write     |
|  version unreleased   | `jira:version_unreleased`  | [link](#project-version-event-payload)        | Write     |

The operation will be used by the sink which supports the upsert of the data to decide if
the event should be inserted/updated or deleted.

### Known Issues

- The archived version is not correctly handled by the Webhook, so when archiving a version the WebHook is correctly
triggered but the `archived` field is always `false`. [Here the opened issue](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-71000).

### Issue Events

For the issue events, it is possible to set a filter to receive only the events related to the issues that match the filter.

Example of a filter is `project = "My Project"`.

:::info
The **event ID** used in the webhook payload is extracted from the `issue.id` field.
