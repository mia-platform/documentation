This source allows the integration connector agent to receive events from AWS CloudTrail published to SQS using Amazon EventBridge.

## AWS Setup

To use this source type, you need to configure your AWS account so that all changes of intereset tracked by CloudTrail
are published to an SQS queue.

To configure AWS, you need to:

- create a new trail in [CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html)
- create a new [SQS queue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/welcome.html)
  dedicated to receiving CloudTrail events
- create an [EventBridge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-setup.html) rule that maps
  the desired sources and sends them to the SQS queue

:::caution
Currently, this source only supports the following resource types:

- S3 bucket (`aws.s3`)
- Lambda function (`aws.lambda`)

:::
