## Device Management

### POST /devices/assign

Assign a device to a patient

#### Request

The body of the request is required.

```json
{
  "deviceId": "apple-12345",
  "deviceType": "Wearable",
  "name": "Apple Watch",
  "deviceProvider": "apple-healthkit",
  "assignedPatientId": "9c86fda0197f4d0e8780daae45bac2f8",
}
```

#### Response

If the device is assigned correctly to the patient, a response with status code `200` and a body with the the `_id` of the new device is returned.

```json
{
  "_id": "32d85aae8b5c4b42addeb2f932579bda"
}
```

If something goes wrong during the request, the response will have a `3xx`, `4xx` or `5xx` status code and a payload looking like this:

```json
{
  "statusCode": "400",
  "error": "Bad request",
  "message": "Error message"
}
```

### POST /devices/:id/unassign

Unassign the device with given `id` from the patient.

#### Request

The body of the request is empty.

#### Response

If the device is unassigned correctly, a response with status code `204` and empty body is returned

If something goes wrong during the request, the response will have a `3xx`, `4xx` or `5xx` status code and a payload looking like this:

```json
{
  "statusCode": "400",
  "error": "Bad request",
  "message": "Error message"

```

## Health Data Management

### GET /health-data

Search and retrieve health data. This is a proxy of the `GET /` endpoint of the [health data CRUD][crud-health-data].

#### Response

A successful response has status code `200` and returns a a list of health data records.

If something goes wrong during the request, the response will have a `4xx` or `5xx` status code and a payload looking like this:

```json
{
  "statusCode": "400",
  "error": "Bad request",
  "message": "Error message"
}
```

### PATCH /health-data/normalize-data/:_id

Normalize the health data with given `_id` and update its `normalizedData` and `normalizedDataType` fields accordingly.

The endpoint fetches the `rawData` and `normalizationRules` and creates the `normalizedData` based on the specified device provider, data type and format.

#### Request

The body of the request is empty.

#### Response

A successful response has status code `200` and returns in the body the updated health data record, like:

```json

### GET /chart-data

This endpoint returns Medisanté health data in a format suitable for chart visualization using [Care Kit `ck-chart`][ck-chart] component.

#### Request

The request requires the following query parameters:

- `normalizedDataType`: the normalized data type defines the metrics to be displayed in the chart as data series (for example, systolic and diastolic blood pressure) while ensure a consistent schema across health data;
- `_id`: the patient ID, to filters health data related to a specific patient;

You can further restrict the health data shown in a chart with the `type` query parameter, which includes in the chart only data with the given raw data type.

#### Response

A successful response has status code `200` and returns a list of available measurements, like diastolic and systolic blood pressure, which are formatted as chart data series.

```json
[
  {
    "name": "systolicBloodPressure [Pa]",
    "data": [
      {
        "x": 1716819504000,
        "y": 16400
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "diastolicBloodPressure [Pa]",
    "data": [
      {
        "x": 1716819504000,

## Therapy and Monitoring Manager integration

### GET /detections/chart-data

This endpoint returns health data from [TMM detections][tmm-crud-detections] in a format suitable for chart visualization using [Care Kit `ck-chart`][ck-chart] component.

#### Request

The request accepts a `filters` query parameter containing one or more [Back-kit filters][back-kit-filters] applicable to [TMM detections][tmm-crud-detections].

```json
[
  {
    "name": "systolicBloodPressure [Pa]",
    "data": [

    "value":"668253dd1f4092358e249610"
  }
]
```

#### Response

A successful response has status code `200` and returns a list of available measurements, like diastolic and systolic blood pressure, which are formatted as chart data series.

If something goes wrong during the request, the response will have a `3xx`, `4xx` or `5xx` status code and a payload looking like this:

### POST /health-data/:_id/detections

Submit detections to the Therapy and Monitoring Manager based on health data with given `_id` and TMM monitoring plans.

The endpoint fetches first the `health-data` then the monitoring plans associated to the patient (health data `patientId`) and based on the same prototype (health data `normalizedDataType`) and, if specified, devices. Finally, it automatically submit normalized data as new detections for all active monitoring plans.
