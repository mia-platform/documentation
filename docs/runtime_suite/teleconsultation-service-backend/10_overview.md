The Teleconsultation Service Backend is a Mia-Platform plugin that acts as a BFF (Backend For Frontend) for the [Teleconsultation Service Frontend][teleconsultation-service-fe], that manages the teleconsultation UI and all the features and tools available during a call using an iframe.

The teleconsultation service uses the [SaaS Kaleyra Service][kaleyra] which allows you to create a video call between two or more people, providing also different tools (like chat, whiteboard, screen sharing, file upload ecc.). It provides also supports image background management and language management (only `it` and `en` are supported at the moment).

The **Teleconsultation Service Backend** allows you to handle all the necessary operations (create, update, delete), on the teleconsultations. The Back End uses the [RESTful APIs][kaleyra-rest-api] provided by Kaleyra.

:::caution
In order to use this service, you need first to contact Kaleyra to create a Company, for your product and get the BANDYER_API_SECRET_KEY (for the Teleconsultation Service Backend).
:::

:::warn
During the teleconsultation, data is processed by Kaleyra, so please be mindful not to share sensitive or personal information. For more details on data processing, refer to Kaleyra's [Terms of Service](https://www.kaleyra.com/terms-and-conditions/) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.kaleyra.com/privacy-policy-kaleyra/).

## Overview

Before continue reading the documentation, it's important to understand some basic concepts about Kaleyra.

#### Company

A **Company** is an account created by Kaleyra.

In order to use Kaleyra's services, Kaleyra has to provide you the `BANDYER_API_SECRET_KEY` to communicate with their RESTful APIs.

:::note
A company has several customizable parameters, like theme, languages, virtual background, etc.

For additional information about company customization, please check [the REST API][kaleyra-rest-api].
:::

:::warning
At the moment, only the italian and the english language are fully supported by Kaleyra.
:::

#### User

To access their services, a user must be registered on Kaleyra.

There are two types of users:
 - **Plus User** - the one who can organize and participate to a call
 - **Basic User** - the one who participates to a call

:::note
In order to start a call, a **plus user** at least is required as participant in the call.
:::

For additional information about users, check [the REST API][kaleyra-rest-api].

#### Room

The virtual place where a call is hosted, is called a Room.

There's the possibility to specify a max duration for a Room in seconds (max time allowed 24h).

For additional information about rooms, check [this link][kaleyra-rest-api].
