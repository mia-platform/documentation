## Migration to v2.0.0

Update the [**BANDYER_BASE_URL**][environment-variables] environment variable. It must be configured with the Bandyer v2 API base url, since the v1.x.x versions of the Teleconsultation service use a different url, that belongs to a deprecated Bandyer API. See the [Kaleyra environments][kaleyra-environments] documentation for more info.
