The _Authentication Service_ is a core service and it is responsible to provide to the final user all the APIs that handles the authentication process as well as all the ones that provide info about the user logged and the providers set as login providers.

This service supports these OAuth2 providers:

- Gitlab
- Github
- Okta
- Microsoft AD and Microsoft AD B2C
- Bitbucket
- Keycloak
- Generic providers, as long as they comply with Oauth 2.0 specifications.

## How it works

The *Authentication Service* service functions as a token broker, interfacing between users and external authentication providers.

Upon successful authentication with a provider, we receive an authorization token which is securely stored and not shared with the frontend application. 
Instead, a distinct, service-specific token is issued for user sessions. 

This method ensures secure separation of authentication tokens, safeguarding original provider credentials while facilitating controlled access to our services.
