In order to configure the Form Service with the Console you need to deploy two services, **Form Service Backend** and the **Form Service Frontend**. Both are available in the Marketplace.

1. Create the Form Service Backend to serve the APIs needed for the correct functionality of the Form Service Frontend.
To create the Form Service Backend you can search for it in the Console Marketplace. Choose a name for the new service (e.g. `form-service-backend`).

2. Create the `/api/v1/forms` endpoint for the newly created microservice. The endpoint of this microservice must be exactly this one because the Form Service Frontend will use this path as prefix for the API calls to the Form Service Backend.

The **Form Service Backend** exposes the `GET /builder/config` and `GET /visualizer/config` endpoints used to configure the **Form Service Frontend**.
These endpoints return the configurations in `JSON` format.

The microservice requires the `FORM_SERVICE_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable to specify the path where the `JSON` is stored. If no path is defined a default configuration will be used.
The default config has only the *formSchemasCrud*, *formSchemaMapCrud* and *formDraftsCrud* fields with default values. See the following sections for further details about these parameters.

To configure the **Form Service Backend** service with the Console, follow these steps:

1. Create the service Form Service Backend, available as ready-to-use plugin in the Marketplace;
2. Add a [custom configuration](development_suite/api-console/api-design/services#custom-configuration):
   - select the configuration *Type* as ConfigMap;
   - insert the configuration *Name*;
   - specify the *Runtime Mount Path* (e.g. `/home/node/app/form-service`).
3. Add a new `JSON` file specifying its *Name* (e.g. `config.json`). The file content is the Form Service Configuration `JSON` and details about it can be found in the following sections.
4. Add the environment variable `FORM_SERVICE_CONFIG_PATH` with the full path of the file created in the previous step (e.g. `/home/node/app/form-service/config.json`).
5. Create the required CRUD collections and configure the environment variables accordingly

The following sections provide a reference guide to all the available configuration options.

## Environment variables

  "formDraftsCrud": "/form-drafts",
  "formMetadata": [],
  "formSubmitUrls": [],
  "formVisualizerOptions": {},
  "formBuilderOptions": {}
}
```

### Theming parameters (`theming`)

This part of the configuration object allows the customization of the Form Builder UI colors. At the moment the following parameters are supported:

- **primaryColor**
  - *type*: string;
  - *required*: `false`;
  - *description*: the primary color that is applied to the Form Builder items and buttons, accepted values are 3, 6, or 8 digits Hex and [CSS color keywords](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#color_keywords);
  - *default*: the micro-lc primaryColor if the Form Builder is used as micro-lc plugin, otherwise the formio.js stylesheet is used.

Here an example of a *theming* object to add in Form Builder configuration `JSON`:

```json
  "theming": {
    "primaryColor": "#22f184"
  }
```

### Form Schemas CRUD endpoint parameter (`formSchemasCrud`)

This parameter is the CRUD endpoint used in the **Form Service Backend** to perform CRUD operations on the forms created with the Form Builder. It can be any CRUD endpoint. The default value is `/form-schemas`.

The properties of the CRUD are:

- **name**, of type *string*;
- **formSubmitUrl**, of type *string*, which specifies the url that will be used for Form submission;
- **formSchema**, of type *object*, which is the property where the configured Form `JSON` will be saved;
- **formVisualizerOptions** , of type *object*, which is the property where the form options `JSON`, will be saved;
- **formAvailabilityDate** (optional), of type *string*, which is the date when the form will be available.
- **formExpirationDate** (optional), of type *string*, which is the expiration date of the form.
- **formExpirationMessage** (optional), of type *string*, which is the expiration message of the form.

:::note

The `formVisualizerOptions` property allows the definition of Form.io options related to the form schema,
for instance, translation options. These options are then used by the Form Visualizer.

This feature is available from Form Service Backend v1.2.2.

:::

In addition, you have to also add to your CRUD properties for the additional Form metadata, defined in [form metadata parameters](#form-metadata-parameters-formmetadata) section.

<details>
<summary>This example show how to use the formVisualizerOptions parameter in the form_schema collection to specify the language for the visualizer in the Form Service Frontend.</summary>

```json
"formVisualizerOptions": {
  "language": "it",
  "i18n": {
    "it": {
      "next": "Avanti",
      "previous": "Indietro",
      "submit": "Conferma",
      "error": "Si prega di correggere gli errori seguenti prima di inviare.",
      "invalid_date": "{{field}} non è una data valida.",
      "invalid_email": "{{field}} deve essere un indirizzo email valido.",
      "invalid_regex": "{{field}} non corrisponde al modello {{regex}}.",
      "mask": "{{field}} non corrisponde alla maschera.",
      "max": "{{field}} non può essere maggiore di {{max}}.",
      "maxLength": "{{field}} deve essere più breve di {{length}} caratteri.",
      "min": "{{field}} non può essere inferiore a {{min}}.",
      "minLength": "{{field}} deve essere più lungo di {{length}} caratteri.",
      "pattern": "{{field}} non corrisponde al modello {{pattern}}",
      "required": "{{field}} è obbligatorio"
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

### Form Schema map CRUD endpoint parameter (`formSchemaMapCrud`)

This CRUD endpoint is used by the **Form Service Backend** to link form data (submitted with a Form Visualizer) to their form schemas, created with the Form Builder. The default value is `/form-schema-map`.

The mandatory properties of this CRUD are:

- **formDataId**, of type *string*, the ID of the submitted form data;
- **formSchemaId**, of type *string*, the ID of the form schema saved in the `formSchemasCrud` endpoint.

In addition (`from Form Service Backend v1.1.1`), you can add the following optional property:

- **options**, of type *object*, to save an additional `JSON` of options to further customize the visualization of a submitted form in the Form Visualizer. The available options can be found in the [form.io documentation](https://help.form.io/developers/form-renderer#form-renderer-options).

The options can be updated for example updated with a [POST decorator](development_suite/api-console/api-design/plugin_baas_4#pre-and-post-decorators) after the submission of a new form.

:::caution

The **Form Service Backend** `PUT /visualizer/forms/:id` endpoint will reply with an error while attempting an update of a submitted form with `"readOnly": true` property in the *Form Schema map* options.

:::

### Form Drafts CRUD endpoint parameter (`formDraftsCrud`)

This parameter is the CRUD endpoint used in the **Form Service Backend** to perform CRUD operations on drafts. It can be any CRUD endpoint. The default value is `/form-drafts`.

The main properties of the CRUD are:

- **data**, of type *object*, which contains the data saved on the draft;
- **formSchemaId**, of type *string*; the ID of the form schema;
- **stableFormId**, of type *string*; The ID of the stable form of the draft.

### Form Metadata parameters (`formMetadata`)

This config section specifies the optional metadata of the Forms created with the Form Builder. An array of *form field* objects must be defined with the following properties:

- **name**, the name of the field;
- **type**, right now the only supported one is *string*;
- **label**, the label you want to show for this field.

Here an example of an additional *category* field:

```json
  "formMetadata": [
    {
      "name": "category",
      "type": "string",
	    "label": "Category"
    }
  ]
```

### Form submit urls parameters (`formSubmitUrls`)

This config section specifies the URLs available to the user to specify where the Form data will be saved upon submission. An array of *submit url* objects must be defined with the following properties:

- **id**;
- **submitUrl** the submission URL;
- **label**: it is not mandatory, it allows to define a user friendly name that will be displayed in the Form Builder as select entry (if missing the `submitUrl` will be used).

Here an example of two endpoints:

```json
  "formSubmitUrls": [
    {
      "id": "satisfaction-survey",
      "submitUrl": "http://crud-service/satisfaction-form-submissions",
      "label": "CMS - Satisfaction surveys"
    },
    {
      "id": "screening-questionnaire",
      "submitUrl": "https://www.external-service.com/screening-form-submissions",
      "label": "App - Screening questionnaires"
    }
  ]
```

The user of the Form Builder will see a dropdown menu with the specified options. If the array is empty or the `formSubmitUrls` is not provided, a text field will be used.

:::caution

The *submit urls* can be either provided with the [CRUD Service](runtime_suite/crud-service/overview_and_usage) or with custom APIs, but it's important that they expose the following methods:

- `GET /{id}`: to return the submitted data of a form by ID;
- `GET /export`: to return all the submitted forms data as newline-delimited JSON;
- `POST /`: to save the data of a new submitted form filled by a user;
- `PATCH /{id}`: to update a submitted form by ID;
- `DELETE /{id}`: to delete a submitted form, it is required to allow rollback when inserts in the *formSchemaMapCrud* fail;

More details on the submit URLs APIs can be found at [this page](./40_submit_urls.md).

:::

### Form Visualizer Options parameters (`formVisualizerOptions`)

This part of the configuration object allows the customization of the Form Visualizer.

Here you can find an example of a *formVisualizerOptions* object:

```json
{
  "autosaveIntervalValueMs": 5000,
  "messageToBeShownOnExpiredForm": "This form is expired!",
  "exportFields": [
    "_id",
    "__STATE__",
    "createdAt",
    "creatorId",
    "updatedAt",
    "updaterId",
    "formSchemaId"
  ],
  "exportLookups": {
    "formSchemaId": {
      "lookupDataSource": "http://crud-service/form-schemas",
      "lookupKey": "_id",
      "lookupValue": "{{name}}"
    },
    "patientId": {
      "lookupDataSource": "http://crud-service/users",
      "lookupKey": "_id",
      "lookupValue": "{{firstName}} {{lastName}}"
    }
  },
  "exportRedirects": [
    {
      "submitUrl": "http://form-data-manager/forms",
      "exportUrl": "http://crud-service/forms"
    }
  ]
}
```

:::note

The value of the auto save interval must be set in milliseconds (from 1 second to 48 hours)

:::

:::note

There is a default value for `messageToBeShownOnExpiredForm` which is `This form is expired!`.

:::

#### Export fields (`exportFields`)

:::info

**v1.7.0**. This setting is available only since version 1.7.0

:::

When you export the form data to a CSV, the CSV file includes all the fields available in the current version of the form schema. If you want to include additional fields available in the response of the `GET /export` endpoint, you must add the field names in this configuration options. These fields are mapped to CSV columns before the form data in the exact same order as they are provided in the configuration. If the form data is stored in a CRUD collection, you may want to include [its predefined properties](runtime_suite/crud-service/overview_and_usage#predefined-collection-properties).

#### Export lookups (`exportLookups`)

:::info

**v1.7.0**. This setting is available only since version 1.7.0

:::

When you export form data by calling the `GET /visualizer/forms/export` endpoint, you can configure the **Form Service Backend** to resolve the value of a CSV column through a CRUD lookup. For example, you may want to replace the form schema ID with the name of the form as shown in the Microfrontend Composer.

To configure the lookup you must assign to the `exportLookups` field an object value, whose properties correspond to the names of the CSV columns you want to perform the lookup on (`formSchemaId` in the example above). Remember, you must use the colum name exactly as it appears on the CSV, so for nested fields you should use the `outerField.innerField` notation.

Each lookup must have the following properties:
- **lookupDataSource**: the URL of the external data source, which must expose a `GET /export` endpoint compatible with the [CRUD Service](runtime_suite/crud-service/overview_and_usage);
- **lookupKey**: the data source field to perform the lookup on, searching for the record matching the column value;
- **lookupValue**: the value to replace the column value with, must be a string with placeholders enclosed between double curly braces; each placeholder must refer a data source field and will be evaluated at runtime and replaced with the corresponding value.

To see how it works, let's suppose we have a CSV with a single row looking like this:

```csv
"_id","formSchemaId","data.birthDate","data.birthPlace"
"6246b2aff30214fb40d3e86d","62162180544cea83e8e130e7","2000-06-15","Rome"
```

If you configured the **Form Service Backend** as shown above the lookup algorithm will search for a record with the `_id` field (the lookup key) equals to `62162180544cea83e8e130e7` (the column value). If the data source contains the following record:

```json
{
  "_id": "62162180544cea83e8e130e7",
  "name": "Medical History 2023"
}
```

the lookup algorithm would find a match and resolve the `name` placeholder with `Medical History 2023`, the value of the corresponding record field, resulting in the following CSV:

```csv
"_id","formSchemaId","data.birthDate","data.birthPlace"
"6246b2aff30214fb40d3e86d","Medical History 2023","2000-06-15","Rome"
```

:::warning

If, for any reason, a lookup on a form field fails, the service ignores the error and simply leaves the existing value unmodified.

:::

#### Export redirects (`exportRedirects`)

:::info

**v1.7.0**. This setting is available only since version 1.7.0

:::

If you are exporting form data associated to a schema with a `submitUrl` pointing to an external service which does not expose a `GET /export` but acts as a proxy towards a CRUD or service with a [compliant API](./40_submit_urls.md), you can configure a redirect, specifying the following properties:

- **submitUrl**: the original submit URL, must match exactly a lookup `lookupDataSource`;
- **exportUrl**: the redirect URL, that is going to be used in place of the `submitUrl` to call the `GET /export` endpoint (the `/export` path is appended at runtime, must not be included in the `exportUrl`).

So, if we have a redirect configured as follows:

```json
{
  "submitUrl": "http://form-data-manager/forms",
  "exportUrl": "http://crud-service/forms"
}
```

the **Form Service Backend**, when encounters a lookup with `submitUrl` equals to `http://form-data-manager/forms`, sends a `GET http://crud-service/forms/export` request to fetch the lookup data.

### Form Builder Options parameters (`formBuilderOptions`)

This part of the configuration object allows the customization of the Form Builder interface by providing the components you wish to add to the builder and customize the options available in their settings.

You can use the [formio.js examples](https://formio.github.io/formio.js/app/examples/) and [documentation](https://github.com/formio/formio.js/wiki) for more details on how you can customize the form builder. The [formio.js sandbox](https://formio.github.io/formio.js/app/sandbox) is a great tool to test the results of your Form Builder Options `JSON`.

Here you can find an example of a *formBuilderOptions* object that can be used in the sandbox mentioned above:

### Form Builder Custom Properties parameters (`formBuilderCustomProperties`)
From version `1.9.0` it is possible to add other properties for customizing the form builder. The properties that can be set are the following:

* **formExpirationDateFormat**: the date format shown in the expiration datepicker. Default is `YYYY-MM-DD`.
* **formAvailabilityDateFormat**: the date format shown in the availability datepicker. Default is `YYYY-MM-DD`.

### Default client type parameter (`defaultClientType`)

From version `1.2.0` the service checks if the `CLIENTTYPE_HEADER_KEY` [environment variable](development_suite/api-console/api-design/services#environment-variable-configuration) is already available in the request's headers. If missing, this parameter allows the customization of the client type that will be forwarded to other platform services. The default value is `formService`.

:::caution

An [API Key](development_suite/api-console/api-design/api-key) with the default value (or a value of your choice) must be created and enabled in the Console in order to ensure the service's functionality.

:::

## CRUD collections

All the following CRUD collections are required.

### form_schemas

In order to perform CRUD operations on the forms created with the Form Service, we recommend to [create a CRUD](development_suite/api-console/api-design/crud_advanced) named `form_schemas`.

The required properties (specified in the [form schemas CRUD endpoint parameter](#form-schemas-crud-endpoint-parameter-formschemascrud) section) of the CRUD can be imported downloading this <a download target="_blank" href="/docs_files_to_download/form-service-backend/form_schemas_crud_fields.json">json file</a>. If any, you need to also add the additional [form metadata parameters](#form-metadata-parameters-formmetadata).

You also need to expose a new endpoint `/form-schemas` following [this guide](development_suite/api-console/api-design/endpoints). You can use a different name paying attention to change the *formSchemasCrud* parameter accordingly.
The type of this endpoint is `CRUD`.

### form_schema_map

This CRUD is required and used by the **Form Service Backend** to link form data (submitted by a Form Visualizer user) with forms created with the Form Builder.

The required properties (specified in the [form schema map CRUD endpoint parameter](#form-schema-map-crud-endpoint-parameter-formschemamapcrud) section) of this CRUD can be imported downloading this <a download target="_blank" href="/docs_files_to_download/form-service-backend/form_schema_map_crud_fields.json">json file</a>.

If you want to use the default value of the *formSchemaMapCrud* you need to expose this CRUD with the `/form-schema-map` endpoint. Any other endpoint must be specified in the configuration `JSON`.

### form_drafts

This CRUD is required and used by the **Form Service Backend** to store draft data (inserted by a Form Visualizer user).

The required properties (specified in the [form drafts CRUD endpoint parameter](#form-drafts-crud-endpoint-parameter-formdraftscrud) section) of this CRUD can be imported downloading this <a download target="_blank" href="/docs_files_to_download/form-service-backend/form_draft_crud_fields.json">json file</a>.

If you want to use the default value of the *formDraftsCrud* you need to expose this CRUD with the `/form-drafts` endpoint. Any other endpoint must be specified in the configuration `JSON`.

Once the **Form Service Backend** is configured you can continue setting up the **Form Service Frontend** following [this guide](runtime_suite/form-service-frontend/configuration).

## Other configurations

### Form export lookup cache

:::info

**v1.7.0**. This feature is available only since version 1.7.0

:::

When you call the `GET /visualizer/forms/export` endpoint to export form data and you have configured some lookups (see section [Export lookups](#export-lookups-exportlookups)), the service uses an internal in-memory cache to store the information required to resolve the lookups, to avoid making a lot of HTTP requests to the external systems. For example, if we had to perform lookups on 3 columns on 100 forms, this may result in up to 300 HTTP requests.

:::danger

Since the service fills the lookup cache with the data required to resolve the lookups, if the data source contains a lot of records, you may notice a high RAM usage that could cause the containers to crash if the service is not configured appropriately.

:::

You can set the expiration and check period for the lookup cache using the environment variables **LOOKUP_CACHE_TTL** and **LOOKUP_CACHE_CHECK_PERIOD**, see the [environment variables section](#environment-variables) for more details.

### Form data versioning support

From `version 1.5.0` the Form-Service Backend supports the versioning of the form data, by including the parameter `_v` to the request performed to retrieve form data. The `_v` is an optional query parameter of the `GET /visualizer/forms/{id}` called by the Form-Service Backend.

In order to forward the `_v` to the service in charge of managing the form data, the `ENABLE_VERSIONING` environment variable must be set to `true`. If not specified, the `_v` parameter will not be included in the request performed to retrieve data, since, by default, the `ENABLE_VERSIONING` variable is set to `false`.

:::warning

Since the `crud-service` does not support document versioning, it will not accept the `_v` parameter, leading to a `400 Bad request` error. When the `submit_url` is a `crud-service` endpoint, the `ENABLE_VERSIONING` **cannot** be set to `true`. 

More in general, the `ENABLE_VERSIONING` variable cannot be set to `true` when the `submit_url` refers to endpoints which do not support the versioning of data and/or when the inclusion of an unknown parameter can leads to error replies.
