## 3.0.0 - 06-10-2020

**BREAKING CHANGE**

- Updated glogger v2.0.3 which brings new logging format, possibly breaking for log processing stack

## 2.3.0 - 03-04-2020

### Added

- implemented initial `connection` support for all currently supported Auth0 routes. Note that this change is not breaking: if clients configuration is not modified to support specific connection then the APIs will work as before.
  Changed routes are the following:
  - `GET /authorize`: will select connection based on request, using first available connection if none is provided;
  - `POST /oauth/token`: in a similar fashion to `/authorize` will use selected connection if supported otherwise defaults to the first available if none is provided.
  - `GET /users`: will filter request connections based on ManagementClient supported connection, if none is provided all supported connections are used;
  - `POST /user/:userId`: will use default connection from ManagementClient if no connection is provided, otherwise will use the one provided (if supported)

## 2.2.1 - 24-02-2020

## Added

- handle graceful shutdown, configurable with new environment variable `DELAY_SHUTDOWN_SECONDS`

## 2.2.0

### Added

- handle grant_type `password` on `/oauth/token` endpoint;

### Fixed

- userinfo, logout and refresh base their flows on Authorization or Cookie headers, ignoring website scope.

### Updated

- Added in the README file a specification for `X-Forwarded-Host` and `Host` header usage, specified also configuration usage for the `website` scope to get a session cookie instead of an Access Token.

## 2.0.0 - 08-01-2020

### BREAKING CHANGE

- changed required env variable `REDIS_HOST` to `REDIS_HOSTS`;
- changed configuration file structure;
- added scope website to obtain a session cookie, otherwise oidc token are returned;

### Added

- supported redis sentinel and multiple redis hosts;

### Fixed

- do not set `Max-Age` for `sid` cookie deletion;
- use [configlib](https://github.com/mia-platform/configlib) library instead of helpers package into service. This fixes the configuration file to be case sensitive;
