## GET /active-users

You may want to know the list of users having an active session, for this purpose we have exposed an endpoint `GET /users/active`.

The endpoint `GET /users/active` returns a list of the active users, for all clients, at the time the call is made.
This list is generated from the active sessions and returns an array of `object` containing the `auth0Id` of the users.

An example of response:

```json
[
  {
    "userId": "auth0|02d90d472bd9d017ef000001"
  },
  {
    "userId": "auth0|02d90d472bd9d017ef000002"
  },
  ...
]
```
