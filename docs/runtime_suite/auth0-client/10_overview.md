This service handles authentication and user management using Auth0 as identity provider.

This service exposes different endpoints to handle authentication: `/authorize`, `/oauth/token`, `/refreshtoken`, `/logout` and `/userinfo` endpoints. A `/users/me` endpoint is also exposed for backward compatibility but its use is discouraged.

Moreover, it handles users through the auth0 users management api.
