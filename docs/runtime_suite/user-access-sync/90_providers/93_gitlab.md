## Events

### User created on Identity Provider - Okta
`event: okta.create.user`

On this event the *middleware* will create a new user on Gitlab.

Below you can find the JSON schema related to the action used to configure this action.
```jsonc
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "providerId": { "type": "string" }, 
        "external": { "type": "boolean" }, // Define wether the user will be created as an external one or not
        "skipConfirmation": { "type": "boolean" }, // Define wether skip the confirmation or not
        "forceRandomPassword": { "type": "boolean" }, // Define wether force a random password or not
    },
    "required": [
        "providerId",
        "external",
        "skipConfirmation",
        "forceRandomPassword",
        ]
}

```
### Update user permission on Mia Console
`event: console.update.user.permission`

On *gitlabGroups* field are listed the groups to which the user should be included if the minimum permissions are fulfilled, so that:
- if the rules is verified, the middleware adds the user to the groups listed
- otherwise:
  - if the user has a role greater than or equal to that defined in the rule, the user is removed from the group
  - otherwise, nothing gets done

For each group the following information are needed:
- *name*: name of the group
- *role*: [Gitlab role](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/members.html#roles) to assign to the user. 

You can use handlebars to add dynamics values to your groups. The following values are handled:
- `{{companyId}}` will be replaced with the company ID related to the event.
- `{{projectId}}` will be replaced with the project ID related to the event.
- `{{environmentId}}` will be replaced with the environment ID related to the event.
