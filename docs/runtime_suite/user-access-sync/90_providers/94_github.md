## Events

### User created on Identity Provider - Okta
`event: okta.create.user`

On *organizations* field are listed the GitHub organizations to which the user should be included if the minimum permissions are fulfilled.
On *teams* field are listed the GitHub teams to which the user should be included if the minimum permissions are fulfilled.
For each organization/team:
- if the rules is verified, the middleware adds the user to the organizations/teams listed
- otherwise:
    - if the user has a role greater than or equal to that defined in the rule, the user is removed from the organizations/teams
    - otherwise, nothing gets done

For each group the following information are needed:
- *name*: name of the organizations/teams
- *role*: [Gitlab role](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/members.html#roles) to assign to the user.

You can use handlebars to add dynamics values to your organizations/teams. The following values are handled:
- `{{companyId}}` will be replaced with the company ID related to the event.
- `{{projectId}}` will be replaced with the project ID related to the event.
- `{{environmentId}}` will be replaced with the environment ID related to the event.
