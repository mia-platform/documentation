Once the _Proxy Manager_ is up and running, you can contact each external service defined in the configuration by sending a request to it at a specific endpoint, which corresponds to the **basePath** field provided in the configuration.

All the subroutes exposed by the external service will also be reachable through the proxy.

## Example of usage

Let's suppose that a user wants to use the Proxy Manager to fetch some data from the endpoint `https://third-party-service.com/api/data`.

The user can define a proxy with the following configuration:

```json
{
  "targetBaseUrl": "https://third-party-service.com/api",
  "basePath": "/third-party-api"
}
```

Now the `/third-party-api/data` endpoint can be called to fetch the data from the third-party service.
