## 8.1.3 - 27-11-2024

### Security

- Added SBOM and docker image sign
- Fix vulnerabilities

## 8.1.2 - 10-09-2024

### Fixed

- query string provisioning when rendering login site with both `appId` and `providerId`

## 8.1.1 - 31-07-2024

### Fixed

- state persistence during authorize flow is now consistent with used tab

## 8.1.0 - 07-05-2024

### Added

- introduce support for alternative login mode, which opens a popup on the identity provider login page instead of
redirecting the current page to the login page. This mode is employed either explicitly by setting the query parameters `external=true`
when calling the login entrypoint or implicitly when embedding the frontend in an iFrame.

## 8.0.0 - 20-02-2024

### Added

- pass the version to the `/authorize` endpoints

### BREAKING

This version is compatible with:
- **Authentication Service** with version **>= 2.8.0** with the option `authorizeStateRequired: true` in the relevant app configurations
- **Auth0-Client** with version **>= 3.5.0** with the option `authorizeStateRequired: true` in the relevant client configuration

The absence of the `authorizeStateRequired` in the service used for authentication will cause the login site to break at login.
