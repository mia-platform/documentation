The API Portal service will present you a graphical interface for your [Open Api specification document](https://swagger.io/resources/open-api/). This service is responsible for contacting an endpoint where your swagger Open Api document should be provided.

This interface will semantically describe the APIs in a readable structure text format and will also allow you to interact and test each of them by clicking on the "Try it" button.

:::note
The available Open Api document is automatically generated and kept in sync by [Swagger Aggregator](../../runtime_suite/swagger-aggregator/overview).  
You can [apply custom configurations directly from the Console](../../development_suite/api-console/advanced-section/swagger-aggregator/configuration)
:::

The Open Api documentation lets you know exactly how your APIs will work and behave, before integrating your APIs into your code. It lists all the available REST-endpoints and provides detailed information for each of them: description, parameters and schema.  

:::note
API Portal generates the [Documentation Portal](../../console/project-configuration/documentation-portal) section of the Console where all services and CRUDs routes are shown and can be tested.
