The **API Portal** microservice can be added to your project by visiting Mia-Platform [Marketplace](/marketplace/overview_marketplace). It works best with the [Swagger Aggregator](/runtime_suite/swagger-aggregator/overview) but it's possible to use it with a custom microservice if the correct data are returned.

:::note
You can select the [API Documentation](/runtime_suite_applications/api-documentation-aggregator/overview) application on the [Marketplace](/marketplace/overview_marketplace) to have a ready-to-use `API Portal` that works with the `Swagger Aggregator` microservice.

## Routes

The **API Portal** requires to expose two routes: `/api/openapi/` and `/api/openapi/raw/`.

The main endpoints are:

* `/api/openapi/json`: it expects a compliant [Open API specification document](https://swagger.io/resources/open-api/). All versions are supported;

* `/api/openapi/subswaggers/`: it expects an array of objects like `[{"name": "<subswagger-name>", "categoryUrl": "<subswagger-url>"}]`. The `categoryUrl` is joined, using [path.join](https://www.npmjs.com/package/path), with `/api/openapi/json`. To understand what is a subswagger, please see [this page](/development_suite/api-console/advanced-section/swagger-aggregator/configuration#subswaggers).

The endpoints regarding the downloads are:

* `/api/openapi/raw/swagger/json` and `/api/openapi/raw/swagger/yaml`: it expects a [Open API v2 (swagger)](https://swagger.io/specification/v2/) object in json and yaml format respectively

* `/api/openapi/raw/openapi/v3/json` and `/api/openapi/raw/openapi/v3/yaml`: it expects a [Open API v3](https://swagger.io/specification/v3/) object in json and yaml format respectively

* `/api/openapi/raw/openapi/v3-1/json` and `/api/openapi/raw/openapi/v3-1/yaml`: it expects a [Open API v3.1](https://swagger.io/specification/) object in json and yaml format respectively

When a category is selected, it calls all the paths above, except for the subswaggers endpoint, joined with the corresponding `categoryUrl`.
For example, if the selected category has `categoryUrl = ../category1.json`, the routes called will be:

* `/api/openapi/category1.json`
* `/api/openapi/raw/swagger/category1.json` and `/api/openapi/raw/swagger/category1.json/yaml`
* `/api/openapi/raw/openapi/v3/category1.json` and `/api/openapi/raw/openapi/v3/category1.json/yaml`
* `/api/openapi/raw/openapi/v3-1/category1.json` and `/api/openapi/raw/openapi/v3-1/category1.json/yaml`


## Environment variables

The API Portal accepts the following environment variables:

- **HTTP_PORT** (default: 8080): defines the http port to use

## How to migrate to v2

To migrate from the `v1.16.14`, you have to:

1. Make sure to update the `Swagger Aggregator` microservice to the latest version (`3.6.0` or above).
2. Remove the following endpoints:
    - `/documentations/api-portal/api/openapi/v3`
    - `/documentations/api-portal/api`
    - `/documentations/openapi`
    - `/documentations/swagger`
3. Add the following endpoints:
    - Endpoint 1:
      * Base path: `/api/openapi`
      * Type: `Microservice`
      * Microservice: `swagger-aggregator`
      * Rewrite base path: it depends on the documentation version you want to see.
        * `/openapi/v3-1` for Open API v3.1
        * `/openapi/v3` for Open API v3.0
        * `/openapi/v2` for Swagger v2
    - Endpoint 2:
      * Base path: `/api/openapi/raw`
      * Type: `Microservice`
      * Microservice: `swagger-aggregator`
      * Rewrite base path: `/`

Now you should have only three endpoints related to the API Portal: `/documentations/api-portal` (or whathever url you decided to expose it), `/api/openapi` and `/api/openapi/raw`
