The integration tests service exposes a single HTTP endpoint to launch a single integration test.

## POST /tests/

Launch a single integration test using [Newman runner][newman].

### Request

The endpoint expects a multipart requests with the following parts:

| Name          | Required | Type  | Description                                                              |
|---------------|----------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `tagName`     | Yes      | field | Name of the tag associated to the test.                                  |
| `testId`      | Yes      | field | Unique identifier of the test.                                           |
| `collection`  | Yes      | file  | A [Postman collection v2][postman-collections-v2] exported as JSON file. |
| `environment` | No       | file  | A [Postman environment][postman-environments] exported as JSON file.     |
| `assets`      | No       | file  | A .zip file containing additional test assets.                           |

You can add more fields, *but not files*, to the request, that are passed to Newman as [environment variables][postman-environments] and can be referenced inside your Postman collection using [handlebars][handlebars].

If the request is valid, the endpoint creates a temporary working directory, saves all the files inside it and launches Newman with the following options:

| Name          | Value | Description                                                              |
|---------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `testId`      | Yes   | Unique identifier of the test.                                           |
| `collection`  | Yes   | A [Postman collection v2][postman-collections-v2] exported as JSON file. |
| `environment` | No    | A [Postman environment][postman-environments] exported as JSON file.     |

After Newman has completed all the tests with the same `tagName`, it creates a new tag on GitLab; the name of the tag is the same as `tagName`, but the `-noartifacts` suffix is replaced with `-artifacts`. 

### Response

If the request is processed correctly, the endpoint returns an HTTP 202 (Accepted) response as soon as Newman starts performing the integration test, since this operation could take a lot of time, with a body looking like this:

```json
{
  "tag": "v1.0.0-artifacts"
}
```

:::tip

You can retrieve the HTML reports generated during the tests by calling the [`GET /reports/:id` endpoint][endpoint-get-reports] and passing as `id` the name of the tag received in the response (`v1.0.0-artifacts` in the example above).

:::

If the request is missing some required fields or files or contains additional files, the endpoint returns an HTTP 400 (Bad Request) response with a payload looking like this:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "message": "A human-readable error message with additional details",
}
```

## GET /reports/:id

This endpoint allows you to retrieve all the HTML reports generated by the tests linked to a given tag.

:::caution

After the endpoint is called, all the references to the tests are removed from the cache and the local working directories.

:::

### Response

If the request is processed correctly, the endpoint returns an HTTP 200 and a payload with the zip file, containing all the reports, each one named according to the original `testId` and having the `.html` extension.
