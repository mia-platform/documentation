## [7.5.6] 2023-09-07

### Fixed

- Strategies not executed when message has old timestamp (__internal__counter)

### Updated

- updated `kafka-importer-lib` to `v7.5.5`

## [7.5.5] 2023-07-21

### Added

- added a docker-compose file and an example of configuration, which allows to automatically configure a demo of the Real-Time Updater
- added a Makefile to simplify the interaction with docker-compose and starting tests using dependencies defined in the docker-compose

### Changed

- updated kafka-importer-lib to include the kafka consumer metrics tracking logic
- updated NodeJS image to v18.17.0 in Dockerfile
- updated the README to provide some insights on the RTU demo
- `db2` can be used now as alias of `basic` when selecting the message adapter 

## [7.5.4] 2023-06-26

### Fixed

- upgrade `kafka-importer-lib` to `v7.5.3` to fix the logic handling Debezium tombstone messages

## [7.5.3] 2023-06-23

### Fixed

- upgrade `kafka-importer-lib` to `v7.5.2` to fix the Debezium Message Adapter implementation.
Now the Real-Time Updater properly support Debezium CDC change events with and without the change schema.

### Changed

- upgraded `nodejs` image, both in Dockerfile and Gitlab-CI to `v18.16.1`
- upgraded service dependencies

## [7.5.2] 2023-05-25

### Fixed

- `kafkaProjectionUpdates` config map accepts topics without `updatesTopic` property, in the format that the console autogenerates.

## [7.5.1] 2023-05-24

### Fixed

- When strategy throws an error the ingestion message is not committed anymore

## [7.5.0] 2023-03-28

### Added

- Added support for Debezium kafka message adapter

## [7.4.1] 2023-03-14

### Changed

- Re-designed the way the projection changes are stored in mongo: now they get `upserted` with a `bulkWrite` operation instead of doing four separate queries for each projection change. The new way is not based on the existence of a unique index to work properly, like it was with the previous implementation. Introduced with kafka-importer-lib@7.4.1

### Fixed

- Projection changes creation does not depend on collection's unique index anymore, fixing the duplicate projections changes bug

### Added

- Upgraded `fast-data-automation-lib@2.3.5` and added `neededFieldsMap` to the strategy execution to make it compatible with new version and improve performance

## [7.4.0] 2023-02-28

### Added

- `golden-gate` message adapter provides additional operations metadata onto which further logics can be enabled to ensure the correct functioning of the data flow. In particular, the `pos` field (generated by CDC system) is employed by default as value of `operationPosition` property to verify that only _newer_ changes are written to the database. Starting from this release, the `operationPosition` property in `golden-gate` message adapter can also be set to adopt the Kafka message's `timestamp` (as it happens with the other message adapters). This change can be implemented by disabling the default behavior setting the `USE_POS_AS_COUNTER` environment variable to `false`

### Fixed

- fixed a behavior regression that caused the service using this library to restart completely whenever a Kafka consumer rebalance event occurred. Consequently, due to the restarts, more rebalance events were triggered, causing even further restarts that could only be solved by stopping all the services using the same consumer group and starting only one of them.

## [7.3.0] 2023-02-17

### Added

- Added K8s health routes using status exposed by Kafka Importer Lib
- Added `custom-plugin-lib` replacing `k8-patient-lib` with kafka-importer-lib@7.3.0

## [7.2.0] 2023-01-17

### Added
- Add possibility to use [OAuthbearer](https://kafka.js.org/docs/configuration#oauthbearer-example) authentication for connecting to Kafka (only grant type password is supported)

### Changed

- upgrade `kafka-importer-lib` to `v7.2.0` to
  - support OAuthBearer authentication
  - fix a situation where `DELETE` operations of `__records__` with a conflicting `__internal_counter` resulted in writing a new record on the database whose key was null.
    This issue occurred when Real-Time Updater is configured in `upsert` mode. 

## [7.1.5] 2022-12-30

### Changed

- upgrade `kafka-importer-lib` to `v7.1.5` to solve multiple bugs on peculiar service configurations

## [7.1.4] 2022-11-18

### Added

- On error processing the message you can now pause the topic instead of tearing down the service. Added the `PAUSE_TOPIC_CONSUMPTION_ON_ERROR` env var
