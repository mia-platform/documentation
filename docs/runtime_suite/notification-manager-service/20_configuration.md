The Notification Manager needs some configuration in order to be used effectively.

## CRUD collections

To use the Notification Manager you need to create the following CRUD collections:

- `users`: a CRUD containing the users;
- `templates`: a CRUD containing the notification templates;
- `event settings`: a CRUD containing the event settings;  
- `events`: a CRUD containing events (used to store details about unknown events);
- `notifications`: a CRUD containing the notifications sent;
- `notification settings`: a CRUD containing the notification settings.

### Users CRUD

This CRUD collection contains the data of the users you want to send messages to. The collection is required and
can be named however you want (we suggest `users`) as long as you specify the name in the `USERS_CRUD_NAME`
[environment variable][environment-variables].

The CRUD collection must have the properties listed in the following table.

| Name         | Type               | Required                | Description                                                                                                                                           |
|--------------|--------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| id           | `string`           | No                      | The user's unique identifier.                                                                                                                         |
| clusters     | `Array of strings` | No                      | A list of clusters the user belongs to (used to decide if the user should be included as a recipient when sending a message to a particular cluster). |
| groups       | `Array of strings` | No                      | A list of groups the user belongs to (used to decide if the user should be included as a recipient when sending a message to a particular group).     |
| roles        | `Array of strings` | No                      | A list of roles associated to the user.                                                                                                               |
| emailAddress | `string`           | For email notifications | A valid e-mail address.                                                                                                                               |
| phoneNumber  | `string`           | For SMS notifications   | A phone number in [E.164 format][e164]format.                                                                                                         |
| deviceToken  | `string`           | For push notifications  | A Firebase devices token.                                                                                                                             |

:::tip
The naming of these properties is up to you. By default, the service will look for the names listed above, but if
you prefer using other names you just need to map them correctly in the `userFields` properties of the 
[service configuration][service-configuration].
:::

:::tip
None of these properties are required. If the service does not find a value for a user, it will simply not send messages
to that user over the missing channel(s).
:::

:::tip
The collection can have any number of additional properties, the service will ignore them.
:::

### Templates CRUD

The templates collection contains all the information needed to create standardized messages.

:::warning
**v2.0.0**. Since version 2.0.0 this collection is required both for sending automatic notifications based on events and whatsapp messaging service. Also, the `name` field is now required.
:::

:::info
**v1.5.0**. Since version 1.5.0 the `pushTitle` and `pushMessage` fields are no longer required, since you can use `pushData` to provide a custom payload for push notifications.
:::

This CRUD collection contains the message templates for sending notifications, both manually (optional) and automatically (required).
Like for the `users` collection, it does not matter how the CRUD is named (we suggest `message_templates`) as long as 
you specify the name in the `TEMPLATES_CRUD_NAME` [environment variable][environment-variables].

The CRUD collection must have the properties listed in the following table.

| Name                       | Type              | Required                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Since version 1.5.0, the `pushData` field is available to customize the push notifications, for example to provide localized messages, and takes precedence over the other fields - `pushTitle`, `pushSubtitle` and `pushMessage`. The field accepts as value a JSON object with the following fields:

- **android** - `object`: android-specific information to be included in the message. The object must conform the shape described [here][google-firebase-push-config].
- **apns** - `object`: information specific to APNS (Apple Push Notification Service). The object must conform the shape described [here][google-firebase-push-config].

:::tip
The fields relative to a channel are required only if plan to use templates, and you want to send messages through that
channel (this applies also to the fields marked as **required** in the list above).

#### Notification messages

Each message in the `messages` field represents a single message sent to the recipient using the given template on a specific channel.

Each message has the properties illustrated in the following table.

| Name           | Type     | Required | Description                                                                              |

| `error`        | `Object` | No       | In case of errors, it contains additional information about the error.                   |

So, for example, if you configure a notification settings with the following reminders:

```json
{
  "user": "auth0|john.doe",
  "channels": ["email", "sms"],
  "templateName": "create-appointment-patient"
}
```

in the notification you could find something like this:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "status": "SUCCESS",
      "channel": "email",
      "templateName": "create-appointment-patient",

#### Notification reminders

Each reminder in the `reminders` field matches the corresponding reminder in the notification settings field with the same name.

Each reminder has the properties illustrated in the following table.

| Name             | Type              | Required | Description                                                                                                             |
|------------------|-------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `status`         | `string`          | Yes      | If the reminder was processed correctly (`ACTIVE` or `ABORTED`) or not (`ERROR`).                                                 |
| `expirationDate` | `string`          | Yes      | When the reminder expires, as an [ISO 8601 date-time][iso-8601-datetime] string.                                                             |
| `expirationId`   | `string`          | No       | The ID of the job scheduled on the Timer Service (if the reminder was processed correctly).                             |
| `schedule`       | `string`          | No       | The reminder schedule, as an [ISO 8601 duration][iso-8601-duration] string.                                                                  |
| `triggers`       | `Array of string` | No       | The IDs of the notification settings that triggered this notification.                                                  |
| `error`          | `Object`          | No       | In case of errors, it contains additional information about the error, like the response received by the Timer Service. |

So, for example, if you configure a notification settings with the following reminders:

```json
{
  "reminders": ["P1D", "PT2H"]
}
```

in the notification you could find something like this:

```json
{
  "reminders": [
    {
      "status": "ACTIVE",
      "expirationDate": "2023-08-12T09:30:00Z",
      "schedule": "P1D",
      "expirationId": "4b5f068c-5f8b-4f0b-ba69-1b0025633edc"
    },
    {
      "status": "ERROR",
      "expirationDate": "2023-08-13T07:30:00Z",
      "schedule": "PT2H",
      "error": {
        "statusCode": 503,
        "error": "Service Unavailable",
        "message": "..."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Notification settings CRUD

:::info

## Channels configuration

### Kaleyra integration
The outbound calling and the whatsapp services will need the Kaleyra integration to work properly. In order to setup the Kaleyra integration, you will need, firstly, to create a Kaleyra account and create an API Key. To successfully set up your Kaleyra account, please refer to the [Getting Started section of the official Kaleyra documentation][kaleyra-getting-started]. The obtained Kaleyra API Key and SID will be provided to the `notification-manager` via environment variables, namely `KALEYRA_API_KEY` and `KALEYRA_API_SID`.

#### Outbound calls
In order to use the outbound calls service, you will then need to setup a valid bridge number, that will be provided to the `notification-manager` in the service configuration map, as stated in the next section.

#### Whatsapp messaging
In order to use the Whatsapp messaging service, you need firstly to enable the Whatsapp channel on your Kaleyra account. When setting up the Whatsapp channel, you will need to create a [WhatsApp Business account][facebook-whatsapp-api] on the Meta developer platform. This account will be then linked to your Kaleyra account. You will also need a [valid phone number][facebook-whatsapp-add-number] to associate to your Whatsapp business account, which will be the number that will appear to users who will receive your messages. This number will be provided to the `notification-manager` in the service configuration map, as stated in the next section.

In order to set up a correct configuration, we kindly recommend to follow the [official Kaleyra documentation for Whatsapp integration][kaleyra-whatsapp-api].

## Service configuration

The service needs a configuration file in JSON format, that can be provided to it as a configmap. You can choose the
name and mounting point of the map, as long as you specify the correct path in the `CONFIGURATION_PATH` [environment variable][environment-variables].

It follows a description of the fields of the map.

- **userFields** - `object`: if you have given a different name to any of the properties listed in the 
[Users CRUD][crud-users] section, you can use this map to tell the service how to find them.
  - **id** - `string`: the name of the property in the Users CRUD containing the user's unique identifier. It will be
matched with the values specified in the [`recipients` field][usage-body]. If not set, the service will use `_id` 
as default.
  - **emailAddress** - `string`: the name of the property in the Users CRUD containing the user's e-mail address.
  - **phoneNumber** - `string`: the name of the property in the Users CRUD containing the user's phone number.
  - **deviceToken** - `string`: the name of the property in the Users CRUD containing the user's device token.
  - **clusters** - `string`: the name of the property in the Users CRUD containing the user's clusters list.
  - **groups** - `string`: the name of the property in the Users CRUD containing the user's groups list.
  - **roles** - `string`: the name of the property in the Users CRUD containing the user's roles list.
  
- **activeChannels (required)** - `string array`: the list of active channels over which each message will be delivered.
  Possible values are `email`, `sms`, `push`, `voice` and `whatsapp`.

:::tip
Keep in mind that even if a channel is active, a user will not receive messages over that channel if the correspondent
property in the [Users CRUD][crud-users] does not have a value.
:::

- **sender** - `object`: the senders for the various channels. Required if at least one among `email`, `sms` and `whatsapp` channels are enabled.
  - **email** - `string`: the e-mail address that will appear as the sender of e-mail messages. Required if the `email` channel is enabled.
  - **sms** - `string`: the sender of the SMS messages. Required if the `sms` channel is enabled. It can be one of the following:
    - a phone number in [E.164][e164] format
    - an alphanumeric sender ID
  - **voice** - `string`: the caller phone number of the voice messages. Required if the `voice` channel is enabled. The phone number **must be registered in the [Kaleyra console][kalyera-manage-numbers]**.
  - **whatsappPhoneNumberId** - `string`: Required when using `whatsapp`. It is the phone number id of the phone number registered in your whatsapp business account. It can be retrieved from the dashboard of the application created inside your whatsapp business account or, alternatively, in the management section of the Whatsapp channel of your Kaleyra account.

:::caution

If you use an alphanumeric sender ID please avoid generic names (e.g. SMS, Info...), otherwise the SMS provider may return an error like [*Invalid 'From' Number*][twilio-invalid-number]. Please check the [SMS Service documentation][sms-service] for more details about supported providers. 
:::

- **voice** - `object`: the configuration for the outbound calls used for voice notifications.
    - **retryCount** - `integer`: the number of retries that can be made until a timeout is reached if the initial call fails to connect.
  The default retry count is 0 and the maximum count is 2. Any value higher than 2 will be considered 2.
    - **speechSpeed** - `string`: the speed of the text-to-speech. The available options are: `slow`, `medium`, `fast`, `x-slow` and `x-fast`. For further info, you must refer to [Kaleyra official documentation][kaleyra-voice-api-params]. If not provided, the default speed is set to `medium`.
    - **speechLanguage** - `string`: the language of the text-to-speech. The available options are: `en-IN`, `en-US`, `es-ES` and `it-IT`. For further info, you must refer to [Kaleyra official documentation][kaleyra-voice-tts-languages]. If not provided, the default language is set to `it-IT`.

- **androidIntentAction** - `string`: the Android intent action that is triggered by the notification (the default value is an empty string).

  - **getTemplateIdFilePath** - `string`: path of the config map file containing the custom function that retrieves a templateId based on the command received. The function must have the following signature: `function getTemplateId: (event: FlowManagerEvent) => string`.
  It follows an example of a valid file.
    ```js
    module.exports = function getTemplateId(event) {
      return event.value.messageLabel
    }
    ```
  - **getDataFilePath** - `string`: path of the config map file containing the custom function that retrieves an object used as data body field, based on the command received. The function must have the following signature: `function getData: (event: FlowManagerEvent) => Record<string, any>`. If not defined the Flow Manager command is used as is.
  It follows an example of a valid file.
    ```js
    module.exports = function getData(event) {
      return {
        ...event,
        value: {
          ...event.value,
          messagePayload: {
            ...event.value.messagePayload,
            amount: event.value.messagePayload.amount.toFixed(2),
          },
        },

    }
    ```

It follows an example of a valid configuration file.

}
```

### Custom event handlers

To register custom handlers, first you need to create a new configuration with an arbitrary name, for example `/home/node/app/custom-handlers`, and assign its path to the [CUSTOM_HANDLERS_FOLDER env var][environment-variables].

Then, to register a custom handler, simply add a new file to the configuration - like `acme-shipping-handler.js` in the snippet above - containing the JavaScript code implementing and exporting your handler, i.e. the function to be executed when a new HTTP request is received notifying a new event to process.

Finally, to get the custom handler loaded at application startup, add or update a record in the [event settings CRUD collection][crud-events-settings] by calling the [`PATCH /event-settings/:id`][patch-event-settings] endpoint with the name of the chosen event, the name of the handler, and optionally a JSON schema for the event validation.

Here's an example of an event settings specifying a custom handler, defined in the `acme-shipping-handler.js` config map, to process `ACME/OrderShipped/v1` custom events.

```json
{
  "eventName": "ACME/OrderShipped/v1",
  "handlerName": "acme-shipping-handler.js",
  "eventSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "description": "AM/AppointmentCreated/v1 notification event",
    "properties": {
      "id": {
        "type": "string",
      },
      "key": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Event key (affected resource, etc.)",
      },
      "name": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Event name",
        "value": "ACME/OrderShipped/v1",
      },
      "metadata": {"...": "..."},
      "payload": {"...": "..."},
    },
    "required": ["name"],
    "additionalProperties": false,
  }
}
```

:::note

The routing table, that specifies which custom or default handler is used to process each type of event, is built once at startup and is updated automatically if you update the [event settings CRUD][crud-event-settings] using one of the following endpoints:

- [`POST /event-settings`][post-event-settings];
- [`PATCH /event-settings/:id/`][patch-event-settings];
- [`DELETE /event-settings/:id`][delete-event-settings].

Any other change requires a service restart to takes effect.

:::

The JavaScript file must export a function with two arguments:

- **service**: a decorated Fastify instance, to access the logger, CRUD proxy, …;
- **event**: the event details;

```json
{
  "id": "event12345",
  "key": "order-12345",
  "name": "ACME/OrderCreated/v1",
  "payload": {
    "...": "..."
  } 
}
```

- **utils**: several [utility functions][custom-handler-api] to send notifications, retrieve users, set reminders, … .

You can find more details about the API accessible inside a custom handler in the [Usage section][custom-handler-api].

Your JavaScript module should therefore look like this:

```javascript
// lodash and luxon libraries can be accessed inside the custom handler
const _ = require('lodash')
const luxon = require('luxon')

module.exports = async function handler(service, event, utils) {
  // Your code to handle the event, this is an example using some of the provided utils
  // Let's imagine we have a single recipient with the ID stored in the userId field of the event payload
  const {payload} = event
  const {userId, startDate} = payload
  const recipients = await utils.getRecipients(service, {_id: userId})
  return recipients.map(async recipient => {
    const notificationSettings = await utils.getNotificationSettings(service, event, recipient)
    const mergedNotificationSettings = utils.mergeNotificationSettings(service, notificationSettings)
    const messages = utils.buildMessages(service, mergedNotificationSettings)
    const messagesNotification = await utils.sendMessages(service, event, recipient, messages)
    const reminders = utils.buildReminders(service, recipient, notificationSettings, startDate)
    const remindersNotification = await utils.setReminders(service, reminderEvent, recipient, reminders)
    const userNotifications = [messagesNotification, remindersNotification]
    return mergeNotifications(event, recipient, userNotifications)
  })
}
```
:::danger

Be careful with the implementation of your handler, since any error raised during its execution would interrupt the processing of the notification event, whose status would be set to `ERROR`.

## Security configuration

General recommendations about endpoint authorization are summarized in the following table.

| Endpoint                    | Recommended authorization level                                               |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| /user-notification-settings | Accessible to all who can change their notification settings.                 |
| /notification-settings      | Accessible to users with admin roles.                                         |
| /notifications              | Accessible to users that monitor anomalies in sending messages and reminders. |

### Event ACLs

If you want to allow certain events to be visible only to certain user groups, you can build a custom solution or you can use [Rönd][rond] to enforce such security policies.

First, you need to configure, for each event type, which user groups have access to it by settings the corresponding `userGroups` field in the [event settings CRUD collection][crud-events-settings]. If the field is not set, the service assumes the event is visible to all users. For example, if you want the `AM/AppointmentCreated/v1` event to be visible only to users belonging to the `doctors` and/or `admins` group, you should configure a CRUD record like this:

```json
{
  "eventName": "AM/AppointmentCreated/v1",
  "userGroups": ["admins", "doctors"]
}
```

If you want to build a custom solution, you can use the [`GET /user/events`][get-user-events] endpoint to retrieve the list of events accessible to the logged user. If you are using [Rönd][rond], you can write a policy fetching directly this information from the [event settings CRUD collection][crud-events-settings].

The following table provides some default policies you can use or extend to protect the most relevant endpoints.

| Endpoint                            | Rönd policy |
|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| `DELETE /notification-settings/:id` |      nm_update_notification_settings       |
| `PATCH /notification-settings/:id`  |      nm_update_notification_settings       |
| `POST /notification-settings/`      |      nm_create_notification_settings       |

Rönd policies and their tests are downloadable from the following links: 
- <a download target="_blank" href="/docs_files_to_download/notification-manager-service/rond_policies_notification_settings.txt">policies</a>
- <a download target="_blank" href="/docs_files_to_download/notification-manager-service/rond_tests_notification_settings.txt">tests</a>

Make sure that the collections written in the policies match the crud collections name specified in the corresponding environment variables.

## Notification settings

This section illustrates with examples how you can leverage notification settings to send messages and reminders to users.

Let's start with an example to break down the notification settings data model:

```json
{
  "eventName": "AM/AppointmentCreated/v1",
  "emitters": ["sarah.cohen", "julie.cross"],
  "group": "doctors",
  "cluster": "st.mary.hospital",
  "channels": ["email", "sms"],
  "hours": ["09:00-18:00"],
  "templateName": "doctor-new-appointment",
  "reminders": ["P1D", "PT6H"],
  "rule": "SEND"
}
```

The `eventName` field targets the `AM/AppointmentCreated/v1`, which is generated when a new appointment is created in the [Appointment Manager][appointment-manager], while the `emitters` field specifies that the notification setting applies only to event emitted by `sarah.cohen` or `julie.cross`; the actual semantic of the `emitters` field value (being a patient ID or something entirely different) depends on the specific event.

The `group` and `cluster` fields, together with `user` and `role`, target a subset of users that belong to the given group and cluster, in the example all the doctors of the fictional _St. Mary Hospital_.

The `channels`, `hours` and `templateName` determine which messages are sent on which channels, in particular the doctors are going to receive an email and a sms message based on the `doctor-new-appointment` template, but only if the event occurs in the 9-18 time slot, which could be their working hours.

The `reminders` field specifies how many and when reminders will be sent, in the example one day (`P1D`) and six hours earlier (`PT6H`); each string represent a duration expressed in [ISO 8601 format][iso-8601-duration] and the event handler is responsible for the type of event associated to the reminder (you can check the [event handlers documentation][default-event-handlers] to find out). Also, the exact moment when the reminders will be sent depends on which date/time the handlers applies the specified durations: in the example, we will send the first reminder one day before the appointment starts, the second one six hours before the appointment starts.

### Reminders

When a handler designed to process a reminder receives the appropriate reminder event (for example the `AM/AppointmentReminder/v1` event, from the example above), the handler receives two key information in the event metadata:

- the `schedule`, which is the notification settings reminder that triggered the event (`P1D` or `PT6H` from the example above);
- the `recipients`, which are the ID of users that should received the messages (it could be a doctor or patient from the appointment or someone from the hospital administration).

These kind of handlers typically fetch the notification settings that apply to the given reminder event, schedule and recipients, assigning a double semantic to the `reminders` field of the notification settings:

- when fetching them, will filter the notification settings containing the given `schedule` in the `reminders` field;
- after the reminders are sent, the handler could set new reminders according to the notification settings `reminders`.

Which of these two semantics are applied depends entirely on the specific behavior of the event handler, could be none or both. We recommend to always check the [event handlers documentation][default-event-handlers] to find out which is the case for each default event handler.

Let's see with an example how we can configure the notification settings to take advantage of these semantics for the `TMM/MonitoringCreated/v1` event, which is triggered when a monitoring plan is created in the [Therapy & Monitoring Manager][therapy-monitoring-manager].

```json
{
  "eventName": "TMM/MonitoringCreated/v1",
  "group": "patients",
  "channels": ["email"],
  "templateName": "patient-monitoring-plan-created",
  "reminders": ["P1D", "PT1H"],
  "rule": "SEND"
}
```

So, when a new monitoring plan is created, the patient receives an email confirmation and two reminders - one day and one hour before the day the monitoring plan starts - are scheduled for the `TMM/MonitoringReminder/v1`. So, let's see how we can configure two different notification settings with different templates for each reminder if the notification settings are filtered according to the reminder schedule:

```json
{
  "eventName": "TMM/MonitoringReminder/v1",
  "group": "patients",
  "channels": ["email"],
  "templateName": "patient-monitoring-plan-reminder-1d",
  "reminders": ["P1D"],
  "rule": "SEND"
}
```

```json
{
  "eventName": "TMM/MonitoringCreated/v1",
  "group": "patients",
  "channels": ["sms"],
  "templateName": "patient-monitoring-plan-reminder-1h",
  "reminders": ["PT1H"],
  "rule": "SEND"
}
```

In the example, we are sending the first reminder one day earlier via email and the second reminder one hour earlier via sms, using different templates.

If the handler is configured to send recurring reminders, for example to send to the patient a reminder each day he or she has to measure the blood pressure, after the current reminder has been processed, it will schedule new reminders according the `reminders` field of the notification settings.

:::info

The following default reminder event handlers filter the notification settings according to the `reminders` field:

- `AM/AppointmentReminder/v1`

The following default reminder event handlers both filter the notification settings and set recurring reminders, until the event is considered expired, according to the `reminders` field:

- `TMM/MonitoringReminder/v1`
- `TMM/TherapyReminder/v1`
