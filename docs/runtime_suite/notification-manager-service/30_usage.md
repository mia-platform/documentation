This sections illustrates how to use the Notification Manager.

As you may recall from the overview you can send notifications in two different ways:

- manually: by sending a request to the [`POST /send`][post-send] endpoint, passing the channels, recipients, template, â€¦ in the request body;
- automatically when specific events occur, by calling the [`POST /notification-events`][post-notification-events].

You can create, update or delete notification settings through the endpoints described in the following section:

- [`GET /notification-settings/`][get-notification-settings]
- [`PATCH /notification-settings/:id`][patch-notification-settingsid]
- [`POST /notification-settings/`][post-notification-settings]
- [`DELETE /notification-settings/:id`][delete-notification-settingsid]

## HTTP API

### POST /send

With this API you can send a new message to your users through different channels.

#### Request

The body of the request should have the following shape.

- **channels (required)** - `array of strings`: list of channels you want to send you message over. Possible values are `email`, `sms`, `push`, `voice` and `whatsapp`.

:::caution
This list has to be a subset of the `activeChannels` property specified in the [service configuration][service-configuration].
:::

- **recipients** - `array of string`: list of unique identifiers of the users you want to send your messages to. Required
if `clusters` is not defined.

- **clusters** - `array of string`: users' clusters you want to send your messages to. Required if `recipients` is not defined.

- **messageTitle** - `string`: title of the message. It will be used as title for e-mails and push notifications. Required 
if `templateId` is not defined. It will be ignored if `templateId` is defined. It supports [interpolation][message-interpolation].

- **messageContent** - `string`: content of the message. It will be used as content for e-mails, sms, push and voice
notifications. Required if `templateId` is not defined. It will be ignored if `templateId` is defined. It supports 
[interpolation][message-interpolation].

- **templateId** - `ObjectId`: id of the template to be used for composing the message. Required if `messageTitle` and
`messageContent` are not defined, or, if you are sending a Whatsapp message.

- **data** - `object`: data used for [messages interpolation][message-interpolation].
 
- **emailAttachments** - `array of strings`: list of filenames that should be sent as mail attachments. The filename must be the same as that used in the file service to download it. It is possible to send attachments no larger than 15 MB. If no File Service is declared in the environment variables an error will be thrown.

  :::tip
If you use a template in which some attachments are listed, they will be merged with the attachments specified in the 
`emailAttachments` property of the request body (i.e. both the attachments specified in the template and in the body
will be sent.)
:::

- **emailCarbonCopies** - `array of strings`: list of email addresses that should be included as carbon copies (CC). Any invalid email addresses will be ignored. Available since version 1.4.0.

- **emailBlindCarbonCopies** - `array of strings`: list of email addresses that should be included as blind carbon copies (BCC). Any invalid email addresses will be ignored. Available since version 1.4.0.

- **emailSender** - `string`: email address of the message sender. This value overwrites the email set in the service configuration. Available since version 2.1.0.

#### Response

#### Exceptions

If something goes wrong during the request, the response will have a `4xx` or `5xx` status code and the following  payload:

```json
{
  "statusCode": "400",
  "error": "Bad request",
  "message": "Exception description"
}
```

#### Success

A successful response (status code `200`) is issued if the process of messages sending starts without errors. However,
it is still possible that the dispatch of some messages to some users fails on some channels. The body of the response
will contain a list of those failures, with a brief explanation of the error, if applicable.

```json
{
  "failures": [
    {
      "userId": "auth0|userId",
      "channel": "whatsapp",
      "error": "Error: Missing required template name for WhatsApp message"
    }
  ]
}
```

### POST /saga/send

With this API you can send a new message to your users through different channels directly with a Flow manager command. You should avoid calling this endpoint in a different way.

#### Body

It has the same structure of a [Flow Manager command][flow-manager-command].

#### Response

#### Exceptions

If something goes wrong during the request, the response will have a `4xx` or `5xx` status code and the following payload:

```json
{
  "statusCode": "400",
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "message": "Exception description"
}
```

Moreover, if enabled by [configuration][service-configuration], it sends an event with `failEventlabel` as messageLabel and empty messagePayload. 

#### Success

A successful response (status code `200`) with an empty body is issued if the process of messages sending starts without errors.

Moreover, if enabled by [configuration][service-configuration], it sends an event with `successEventlabel` as messageLabel and empty messagePayload. 

### POST /notification-events/

:::caution

**v2.3.0**. Since v2.3.0 the endpoint accepts arbitrary fields in the request body JSON object, that are automatically merged inside the event `payload`.
If a field with the same name already exists in the event `payload`, the corresponding value will be overwritten.

:::

:::info

**v2.0.0**. This endpoint is available only since v2.0.0.

:::

This endpoint allows you to notify that an event occurred and trigger the sending of notifications according to the notification settings.

This endpoint takes care of routing the request to the appropriate handler depending on the event:

1. if a custom handler is registered for the event, the event payload will be passed to the registered handler;
2. if no custom handler is registered for the event, the event payload will be passed to a default handler, if available;
3. otherwise, the event will be considered as not processable, a response with `400` status code will be returned and and a record will be created in the `events` CRUD.

:::warning

The event settings are loaded once at startup, so please note that, if you change anything in the [event settings CRUD][crud-event-settings], including updating the handler name or schema or deleting the settings entirely, the effects will be visible only after the service has been restarted.

:::

After an handler is found, the event is validated against its schema. All default events have a schema to be validated against, but it is not mandatory to provide a schema for custom events; if none is specified in the corresponding [Event settings][crud-event-settings] document, no validation is performed.

This endpoint creates a record in the notifications CRUD you can later query using the returned `_id` to check the actual messages sent to the users on the various channels.

#### Request body

The request body must be a JSON object with the fields described in the the following table.

| Name     | Type     | Required | Description                                                                               |
|----------|----------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| name     | `string` | Yes      | Event name.                                                                               |
| id       | `string` | No       | Event identifier (must be unique across the system).                                      |
| key      | `string` | No       | Event key (ID of the main resource associated to the event, like an appointment or plan). |
| metadata | `Object` | No       | Event metdata, to provide additional details to the event handler.                        |
| payload  | `Object` | No       | Event payload                                                                             |

#### Response

A successful response (status code `200`) is issued if the notifications were processed without errors. However,
it is still possible that the dispatch of some messages to some users fails on some channels.
The body of the response will contain the list of the notifications sent, to allow the client to check if failures occurred sending the messages.

```json
{
  "_id": "ID of the notification created in the notifications CRUD",
  "notifications": []
}
```

If there is no handler available to process the event, the response will return a `400` status code and a payload looking like this:

```json
{
  "statusCode": "400",
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "message": "Unknown event"
}
```

If any other error occurs, the response will return a `4xx` or `5xx` status code and a payload looking like this:

```json
{
  "statusCode": "400",
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "message": "Error description"
}
```

:::info

**v2.0.0**. This endpoint is available only since v2.0.0.

:::

This endpoint returns the event settings that apply to events visible to the logged user.

If a default event has no settings, it will be considered visible to all users and the supported channels will include all the active channels from the [service configuration][service-configuration].

An event is visible to the user if and only if the user belongs to at least one of the groups listed in the `userGroups` fields of the CRUD for an event or no `userGroups` is specified.

The supported channels are automatically filtered to be a subset of the active channels from the [service configuration][service-configuration].

The enabled channels are automatically filtered to be a subset of the supported channels.

#### Response

If the request is processed correctly, the service returns a response with a 200 status code and a list of events looking like this:

```json
[
  {
    "eventName": "AM/AppointmentCreated/v1",
    "supportedChannels": [
      "voice",
      "push"
    ],
    "enabledChannels": [
      "voice"
    ]
  }
]
```

Each event has the properties described in the following table.

| Name              | Type       | Description                                                                                                                                                |

| supportedChannels | `string[]` | The supported channels from the [event settings CRUD][crud-event-settings] or the active channels from the [service configuration][service-configuration]. |
| enabledChannels   | `string[]` | The channels enabled for the event in the notification settings targeting the user.                                                                        |

### PATCH /user/notification-settings/

:::info

**v2.1.0**. This endpoint is available only since version 2.1.0.

:::

Update all the notification settings targeting a specific event and user (and optionally roles, groups and clusters).

If no user notification settings is updated, a new one is created targeting the given event and user. The template name will be inherited from the notification settings with highest precedence that targets the user group, role or cluster.

#### Request

The request body must provide the event name (`eventName`) and the list of enabled channels (`enabledChannels`).

```json
{
  "eventName": "AM/AppointmentCreated/v1",
  "enabledChannels": ["email", "sms"]
}
```

For each notification setting targeting the logged user and the given event, the channels (`channels`) are overwritten with the enabled channels.

#### Response

If the request is processed correctly, the endpoint returns a 200 HTTP status code and a response containing the number of notification settings updated.

If the service encounters an error processing the request, it responds with the appropriate status code (3xx, 4xx or 5xx) and a JSON body looking like this:

```json
{
  "statusCode": "500",
  "error": "Internal Server Error",
  "message": "An error occurred while processing the request"
}
```

Here are the most common errors: 

- if the user is not authenticated, the service returns a 401 (`Unauthorized`) error;
- if the event is not visible to the user, the service returns a 403 (`Unauthorized`) error;
- if the user tries to enable an unsupported channel, the service returns a 400 (`Bad Request`) error;
- if a new user notification settings must be created but there are no notification settings to inherit the template name from, the service returns a 400 (`Bad Request`) error.

```

This function takes an event (required), a user (optional) and a list of emitters (optional) and return the [notification settings][crud-notification-settings] that apply to the event and, if provided, to the given user and emitters.

A notification setting applies to an event if its `eventName` matches the event name (`event.name`).

A notification setting applies to a user if all the following conditions are satisfied:
- if the user id (`user.id`) is specified, the rule must target the same user, i.e. the `user` field must match the `user.id`;
- if the user belongs to one or more groups (`user.groups`), the rule must target one of these groups, i.e. the `group` field must match one of the values in the `user.groups` field;
- if the user belongs to one or more clusters (`user.clusters`), the rule must target one of these clusters, i.e. the `cluster` field must match one of the values in the `user.clusters` field;
- if the user has one or more roles (`user.roles`), the rule must target one of these roles, i.e. the `role` field must match one of the values in the `user.roles` field.

A notification setting applies to the given list of emitters if its `emitters` field contains at least one of the given emitters.

The list of notification settings is sorted according to the following precedence (from highest to lowest).
1. *user*: settings targeting a specific user have precedence over rules targeting clusters, roles and/or groups;
2. *cluster*: settings targeting a cluster have precedence over rules targeting roles and/or groups;
3. *role*: settings targeting a role have precedence over rules targeting groups;
4. *group*.

Notification settings with the same precedence (for example, rules targeting a specific user) are recursively sorted based on the precedence of the remaining fields (for example, rules targeting a user are sorted again to have rules targeting a cluster before rules targeting groups and roles and so forth).

For example, if we had some notification settings targeting:

- a single doctor (`user`);
- a single doctor (`user`) in a hospital (`clusters`);
- all doctors (`groups`) in a hospital (`clusters`);
- all doctors  (`groups`) that can sign patient's discharge (`roles`);
- all doctors (`groups`)

they would be sorted as follows:

1. a single doctor (`user`) in a hospital (`clusters`);
2. a single doctor (`user`);
3. all doctors (`groups`) in a hospital (`clusters`);
4. all doctors  (`groups`) that can sign patient's discharge (`roles`);
5. all doctors (`groups`).

### mergeNotificationSettings

```
mergeNotificationSettings(service, notificationSettings)
```

This function takes a list of CRUD notification settings and filters them according to the following criteria:

1.  Remove all settings with `IGNORE` rule;
2.  Discard the settings with `SEND` rule that have lower precedence;
3.  Discard the rules that define one or more sending hours not matching the current time.

The process by which precedence is given to the notification settings is explained in the [getNotificationSettings][utils-get-notification-settings] method description.

  {"schedule": "PT1H", "expirationDate": "2023-06-25T08:30:00Z", "recipients": ["doctorId"]},
]
```

### setReminders

```
async setReminders(service, event, user, reminders)
```

This functions takes as input a list of [reminders][crud-notification-reminders] for a given user and event, like those generated by the [`buildReminders` utility function][build-reminders], and schedule them by calling the [Timer Service][timer-service]. If the list of reminders is empty, no record is stored in the [notifications CRUD][crud-notifications].

For each provided reminder, at the expiration date the Timer Service will send a request to the [POST /notification-events/][post-notification-events].

For example, if we have the following reminder:

```json
{
  "expirationDate": "2023-09-02T09:30:00.000Z",
  "schedule": "P1D",
  "recipients": ["customer-id"],

```json
{
  "payload": {
    "id": "f5a9ed5f-c6c2-44e6-85a4-1bd64458a4c0",
    "key": "order-12345",
    "name": "ACME/OrderCreated/v1",

## Event handlers

This section illustrates how events are processed by the default handlers available in the Notification Manager.

All the events mentioned in the following sections follow this naming convention:

```
<product>/<event>/<version>
```

where:

- `product` represent the name, usually abbreviated and in upper case, of the Mia Care product for which the event was originally designed, like `AM` (Appointment Manager) or `TMM` (Therapy and Monitoring Manager);
- `event`: the name, usually in camel case, of the event, like appointment created (`AppointmentCreated`) or therapy updated (`TherapyUpdated`);
- `version`: the version of the event, which should be incremented every time a breaking change to the metadata or payload schema is introduced.

:::tip

You can override a default event handlers by providing a [custom handler][custom-handlers] for any of the events discussed below.

:::

### AM/AppointmentCreated/v1

This event is fired when a new appointment is created in the [AM][appointment-manager] and it looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "AM/AppointmentCreated/v1",
  "key": "appointment-12345",
  "metadata": {
    "userFields": ["resourceId", "participantIds"]
  },
  "payload": {
    "startDate": "2023-08-01T09:30:00Z",
    "endDate": "2023-08-01T10:15:00Z",
    "resourceId": "auth0|dr.mario.rossi",
    "participantIds": [
      "auth0|jenny.king",
      "auth0|dr.mark.greene"
    ],
    "...": "..."
  }
}
```

When the handler receives such an event it performs the following operations:

1. retrieve the list of participant IDs from the `metadata.userFields` and fetch the users details by calling the `getRecipients` utility function;
2. for each participant:
    1. fetch the notification settings that applies by calling the `getNotificationSettings` utility function
    2. merge the notification settings by calling the `mergeNotificationSettings` utility function
    3. get the messages to send by calling the `buildMessages` utility function
    4. send the messages by calling the `sendMessages` utility function
    5. get the reminders to send by calling the `buildReminders` utility function
    6. set the reminders by calling the `setReminders` function and passing an event with the same payload and metadata of the original, but with name `AM/AppointmentReminder/v1`

### AM/AppointmentReminder/v1

After an appointment is created or updated and the reminders scheduled, the [Timer Service][timer-service] sends to the NM at the appropriate times a new event named `AM/AppointmentReminder/v1`. The event looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "AM/AppointmentReminder/v1",
  "metadata": {
    "reminder": {
      "schedule": "PT1H",
      "expirationDate": "2022-06-04T23:00:00Z",
      "recipients": ["auth0|dr.mark.greene"]
    },
    "userFields": ["resourceId", "participantIds"]
  },
  "payload": {
    "startDate": "2023-08-01T09:30:00Z",
    "endDate": "2023-08-01T10:15:00Z",
    "resourceId": "auth0|dr.mario.rossi",
    "participantIds": [
      "auth0|joe.hart",
      "auth0|dr.mark.greene"
    ],
    "...": "..."
  }
}
```

The event should include in the `metadata.reminder` field the schedule that triggered this event. The value is a time duration expressed as [ISO 8601 duration string][iso-8601-duration].

When the handler receives such an event it performs the following operations:

1. retrieve the list of participant IDs from the `event.metadata.reminder.participants` field and fetch the users detail by calling the `getRecipients` function;
2. for each participant:
    1. fetch the notification settings that applies by calling the `getNotificationSettings` function;
    2. filter the notification settings having the `event.metadata.reminder.schedule` among the reminders, if provided;
    3. merge the notification settings by calling the `mergeNotificationSettings` utility function
    4. build the messages to send by calling the `buildMessages` utility function
    5. send the messages by calling the `sendMessages` utility function

### AM/AppointmentDeleted/v1

When an appointment is deleted the [AM][appointment-manager] sends to the NM a new event named `AM/AppointmentDeleted/v1` that looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "AM/AppointmentDeleted/v1",
  "metadata": {
    "userFields": ["resourceId","participantIds"]
  },
  "payload": {
    "startDate": "2023-08-01T09:30:00Z",
    "endDate": "2023-08-01T10:15:00Z",
    "resourceId": "auth0|dr.mario.rossi",
    "participantIds": [
      "auth0|mary.shelley",
      "auth0|dr.mark.greene"
    ],
    "...": "..."
  }
}
```

When the handler receives such an event it performs the following operations:

1. retrieve the list of participant IDs from the `metadata.userFields` and fetch the users details by calling the `getRecipients` utility function; 
2. for each user:
    1. fetch the notification settings that apply by calling the `getNotificationSettings` utility function;
    2. merge the notification settings by calling the `mergeNotificationSettings` utility function
    3. get the messages to send by calling the `buildMessages` utility function
    4. send the messages by calling the `sendMessages` utility function
    5. abort all active reminders scheduled when the appointment was created or updated by calling the `abortReminders` utility functions.

### AM/AppointmentUpdated/v1

This event is triggered by an update to an appointment that is performed by a request to the `PATCH /appointments/:id` of the Appointment Manager. The event looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "AM/AppointmentUpdated/v1",
  "metadata": {
    "userFields": ["resourceId","participantIds"]
  },
  "payload": {
    "originalAppointment": {
      "startDate": "2023-08-01T09:30:00Z",
      "endDate": "2023-08-01T10:15:00Z",
      "resourceId": "auth0|dr.mario.rossi",
      "participantIds": [
        "auth0|lucia.verdi",
        "auth0|dr.luigi.rossi"
      ],
      "...": "..."
    },
    "currentAppointment": {
      "startDate": "2023-08-01T09:30:00Z",
      "endDate": "2023-08-01T10:15:00Z",
      "resourceId": "auth0|dr.mario.rossi",
      "participantIds": [
        "auth0|lucia.verdi",
        "auth0|dr.marta.rossi"
      ],
      "...": "..."
    }
  }
}
```

When the handler receives such an event it performs the following operations:
1. retrieve the list of participant IDs from the `metadata.userFields` and fetch the users details;
2. cluster the participant IDs in the following groups:
   1. new participants: if the user ID is in the updated appointment, but not in the original;
   2. existing participants: if the user ID is in both the updated and original appointment;
   3. deleted participants: if the user ID is in the original appointment, but not in the updated version;
3. for each participant:
   1. fetch the notification settings that apply by calling the `getNotificationSettings` utility function with the correct event:
      1. for new participants, `AM/AppointmentCreated/v1` as event name and the updated appointment as payload;
      2. for existing participants, the original event;
      3. for deleted participants, `AM/AppointmentDeleted/v1` as event name and the original appointment as payload;
   2. merge the notification settings by calling the `mergeNotificationSettings` utility function;
   3. for deleted participants, and for existing participants if the appointment has been rescheduled, abort the reminders by calling the `abortReminders` utility function;
   4. get the messages to send by calling the `buildMessages` utility function;
   5. send the messages by calling the `sendMessages` utility function with the correct event:
      1. for new participants, `AM/AppointmentCreated/v1` as event name and the updated appointment as payload;
      2. for existing participants, the original event;
      3. for deleted participants, `AM/AppointmentDeleted/v1` as event name and the original appointment as payload;
   6. for new participants, and for existing participants if the appointment has been rescheduled:
      1. get the reminders to send by calling the `buildReminders` utility function;
      2. set the reminders by calling the `setReminders` function and passing an event with the updated appointment as payload and name `AM/AppointmentReminder/v1`.

### IC/ResourceForbiddenEvent/v1

This event is fired when a resource integrity violation is detected by the [IC][integrity-checker] and the event looks like this:

```json
{
  "id": "8f77103f-9466-418b-b9e9-478054f82900",
  "key": "medical-reports/628fa7713d35760c790b8f30",
  "name": "IC/ResourceForbiddenEvent/v1",
  "payload": {
    "collectionName": "medical-reports",
    "resourceUuid": "628fa7713d35760c790b8f30",
    "operation": {
      "updatedFields": {
        "signedDocument": "61669154bea7010012c9ebd2.pdf"
      }
    },
    "resource": {
      "_id": "628fa7713d35760c790b8f30",
      "creatorId": "auth0|dr.lucia.viola",
      "createdAt": "2022-05-26T16:14:41.621Z",
      "updaterId": "auth0|dr.andrea.rossi",

      "data": {},
      "uuid": "KGWfJ31BL4mgVpu"
    }
  }
}

```

When the handler receives such an event it performs the following operations:
1. fetch the notification settings that apply to the event by calling the `getNotificationSettings` utility function;
2. merge the notification settings by calling the `mergeNotificationSettings` utility function;
3. fetch all the users targeted by the notification settings; 
4. for each user:
   1. build the messages to send by calling the `buildMessages` utility function;
   2. send the messages by calling the `sendMessages` utility function;

### TMM/MonitoringCreated/v1

This event is fired when a new monitoring plan is created in the [TMM][therapy-monitoring-manager] and the event looks like this:

```json
{
  "id": "06efe38d-0e46-4863-9bb4-4c11ff63c912",
  "key": "blood-pressure-monitoring-12345",
  "name": "TMM/MonitoringCreated/v1",
  "metadata": {
    "excludeUsers": ["jill.marlowe"],
    "includeUsers": ["dr.john.watson"]
  },
  "payload": {
    "planName": "Blood pressure monitoring",
    "prototypeId": "bloodPressure",
    "notes": "Takes the blood",
    "startDate": "2022-06-01T00:00:00Z",
    "endDate": "2022-06-15T00:00:00Z",
    "each": ["day"],
    "times": 2,
    "doctorId": "dr.mark.greene",
    "patientId": "jill.marlowe",
    "adherenceStatus": "enabled",
    "adherenceToleranceFrequency": 1,
    "adherenceMinimumPercentage": 90,
    "complianceStatus": "enabled",
    "complianceMinimumPercentage": 90,
    "thresholds": [
      {
        "propertyName": "minimumBloodPressure",
        "thresholdOperator": "gt",
        "thresholdValue": 60
      },
      {
        "propertyName": "maximumBloodPressure",
        "thresholdOperator": "gt",
        "thresholdValue": 120
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

When the handler receives such an event it performs the following operations:

1. fetch the details of the doctor and patient by calling the `getRecipients` utility function and passing the values of the `doctorId` and `patientId` as ids;
2. remove the users in `metadata.excludeUsers` from the participants;
3. add the users in `metadata.includeUsers` to the participants;
4. for each user:
   1. fetch the notification settings by calling the `getNotificationSettings` utility function;
   2. merge the notification settings by calling the `mergeNotificationSettings` utility function;
   3. get the messages to send by calling the `buildMessages` utility function and passing the merged notification settings as argument;
   4. send the messages by calling the `sendMessages` utility function;
   7. compute the first event date according to the monitoring plan;
   8. build the reminders by calling `buildReminders`;
   9. schedule the reminders by calling the `setReminders` for the `TMM/MonitoringReminder/v1` event;
   10. merge the user notifications by calling the `mergeNotifications`.

### TMM/MonitoringDeleted/v1

This event is fired when a monitoring plan is deleted in the [TMM][therapy-monitoring-manager] and the event looks like this:

```json
{
  "id": "da03558a-f283-4d9b-b1c7-50282716802c",
  "key": "blood-pressure-monitoring-12345",
  "name": "TMM/MonitoringDeleted/v1",
  "metadata": {
    "excludeUsers": ["lucy.heart"],
    "includeUsers": ["dr.john.watson"]
  },
  "payload": {
    "planName": "Blood pressure monitoring",
    "prototypeId": "bloodPressure",
    "notes": "Takes the blood",
    "startDate": "2022-06-01T00:00:00Z",
    "endDate": "2022-06-15T00:00:00Z",
    "each": ["day"],
    "times": 2,
    "doctorId": "dr.mark.greene",
    "patientId": "lucy.heart",
    "adherenceStatus": "enabled",
    "adherenceToleranceFrequency": 1,
    "adherenceMinimumPercentage": 90,
    "complianceStatus": "enabled",
    "complianceMinimumPercentage": 90,
    "thresholds": [
      {
        "propertyName": "minimumBloodPressure",
        "thresholdOperator": "gt",
        "thresholdValue": 60
      },
      {
        "propertyName": "maximumBloodPressure",
        "thresholdOperator": "gt",
        "thresholdValue": 120
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
When the handler receives such an event it performs the following operations:

1. add the doctor (`payload.doctorId`) and patient (`payload.patientId`) to the list of notification recipients;
2. add the user IDs in the `metadata.includeUsers` field to the recipients list, if present;
3. remove the user IDs in the `metadata.excludeUsers` field from the recipients list, if present;
4. for each recipient:
   1. fetch and merge the notification settings that applies to the given event and participant;
   2. build and send the messages to the participant;
   3. abort all active reminders scheduled when the monitoring was created or updated or a recurring reminder was set.

The fourth step relies on the [notification utils][custom-handler-api] available in all handlers to perform most of the operations.

### TMM/MonitoringUpdated/v1

This event is fired when a monitoring plan is updated in the [TMM][therapy-monitoring-manager] and the event looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "TMM/MonitoringUpdated/v1",
  "metadata": {
    "excludeUsers": ["dr.mario.rossi"],
    "includeUsers": []
  },
  "payload": {
    "originalMonitoring": {
      "planName": "Blood pressure monitoring",
      "prototypeId": "bloodPressure",
      "notes": "Takes the blood",
      "startDate": "2022-06-01T00:00:00Z",
      "endDate": "2022-06-15T00:00:00Z",
      "each": ["day"],
      "times": 2,
      "doctorId": "dr.mario.rossi",
      "patientId": "lucia.viola",
      "adherenceStatus": "enabled",
      "adherenceToleranceFrequency": 1,
      "adherenceMinimumPercentage": 90,
      "complianceStatus": "enabled",
      "complianceMinimumPercentage": 90,
      "thresholds": [
        {
          "propertyName": "minimumBloodPressure",
          "thresholdOperator": "gt",
          "thresholdValue": 60,
        },
        {
          "propertyName": "maximumBloodPressure",
          "thresholdOperator": "gt",
          "thresholdValue": 120
        }
      ]
    },
    "currentMonitoring": {
      "startDate": "2022-06-01T00:00:00Z",
      "endDate": "2022-07-01T00:00:00Z",
      "each": ["monday", "wednesday", "friday"],
      "doctorId": "dr.andrea.verdi",
      "patientId": "lucia.viola",
      "...": "...",
    }
  }
}
```

The payload must have both the original and the updated version of the monitoring plan, in order for the handler to correctly identify the messages to send and the reminders to abort or schedule. In the example above, we are both changing the participants (`doctorId`) and the plan schedule (`endDate`, `each`).

When the handler receives such an event it performs the following operations:

1. cluster the user IDs (`doctorId`, `patientId`) in three groups:
   1. new participants: if the user ID is in the updated monitoring, but not in the original;
   2. existing participants: if the user ID is in both the updated and original monitoring;
   3. old participants: if the user ID is in the original monitoring, but not in the updated version;
2. add the user IDs in the `metadata.includeUsers` field to the list of existing recipients, if present;
3. remove the user IDs in the `metadata.excludeUsers` field from any recipients list, if present;
4. fetch the user details of all the participants;
5. for each new participant, using `TMM/MonitoringCreated/v1` as event name and the updated monitoring as payload:
   1. fetch and merge the notification settings that applies to the event;
   2. build and send the messages to the participant;
6. for each old participant, using `TMM/MonitoringDeleted/v1` as event name and the original monitoring as payload:
   1. fetch and merge the notification settings that applies to the event;
   2. build and send the messages to the participant;
   3. abort all active reminders scheduled when the monitoring was created or previously updated;
7. for each existing participant:
   1. fetch and merge the notification settings that applies to the given event and participant;
   2. build and send the messages to the participant;
   3. abort all active reminders scheduled when the monitoring was created or updated;
   4. build and schedule all the reminders, using `TMM/MonitoringReminder/v1` as reminder event name and the current appointment as payload.

The last four steps rely on the [notification utils][custom-handler-api] available in all handlers to perform most of the operations.

### TMM/MonitoringReminder/v1

This event is fired when the patient is notified about an ongoing monitoring plan in the [TMM][therapy-monitoring-manager] and the event looks like this:

```json
{
  "id": "06efe38d-0e46-4863-9bb4-4c11ff63c912",
  "key": "blood-pressure-monitoring-12345",
  "name": "TMM/MonitoringReminder/v1",
  "metadata": {
    "reminder": {
      "schedule": "PT1H",
      "expirationDate": "2022-06-04T23:00:00Z",
      "recipients": ["jill.marlowe"]
    }
  },
  "payload": {
    "planName": "Blood pressure monitoring",
    "prototypeId": "bloodPressure",
    "notes": "Takes the blood",
    "startDate": "2022-06-01T00:00:00Z",
    "endDate": "2022-06-15T00:00:00Z",
    "each": ["day"],
    "times": 2,
    "doctorId": "dr.mark.greene",
    "patientId": "jill.marlowe",
    "adherenceStatus": "enabled",
    "adherenceToleranceFrequency": 1,
    "adherenceMinimumPercentage": 90,
    "complianceStatus": "enabled",
    "complianceMinimumPercentage": 90,
    "thresholds": [
      {
        "propertyName": "minimumBloodPressure",
        "thresholdOperator": "gt",
        "thresholdValue": 60
      },
      {
        "propertyName": "maximumBloodPressure",
        "thresholdOperator": "gt",
        "thresholdValue": 120
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This handler automatically schedules the next reminder according to the following criteria:

- if the plan has a daily schedule (the `each` field contains `day`), the reminders are sent at the beginning of each day;
- if the plan has a weekly schedule (the `each` field contains one or more weekdays, like `monday` or `friday`), the reminders are sent at the beginning of each day of the week specified in the plan.

The reminders are scheduled if and only if the monitoring plan is still active on a given day and are sent the desired time before midnight UTC, for example one hour.

:::tip

The notification settings for monitoring reminders should set a single reminder no more than a few hours before each day the patient needs to take action, particularly if the plan has a daily schedule.

:::

Given the monitoring plan shown above, for example, and the following notification setting:

```json
{
  "eventName": "TMM/MonitoringReminder/v1",
  "channels": ["email", "sms"],
  "templateName": "patient-monitoring-reminder",
  "user": "jill.marlowe",
  "reminders": ["PT1H"]
}
```

we would send the following reminders:

- May 31st, 2022 at 23:00 UTC (reminder for June 1st, one hour earlier than midnight UTC);
- June 1st, 2022 at 23:00 UTC (reminder for June 2nd, one hour earlier than midnight UTC);
- etc.
- June 14th, 2022 at 23:00 UTC (reminder for June 15th, one hour earlier than midnight UTC).

When the handler receives such an event it performs the following operations:

1. add the user IDs from the reminder recipients (`metadata.reminder.recipients`) to the list of notification recipients;
2. for each recipient:
   1. fetch and merge the notification settings that apply to the given event and user;
   2. filter the notification settings whose `reminders` field contains the reminder schedule (`metadata.reminders.schedule`);
   3. build and send the messages to the participant;
   4. build and schedule the next reminders, according to the notification settings and using the same event.

### TMM/ThresholdExceeded/v1

This event is fired when a detection submitted by a patient exceeds one or more thresholds associated to a monitoring plan in the [TMM][therapy-monitoring-manager] and the event looks like this:
 

```json
{
  "id": "f303f2e9-f37b-4565-91e4-628e36872df5",

        },
        {
          "propertyName": "maximumBloodPressure",
          "thresholdOperator": "gt",
          "thresholdValue": 120
        }
      ]
    },

        "status": "OK"
      },
      {
        "threshold": {
          "propertyName": "maximumBloodPressure",
          "thresholdOperator": "gt",
          "thresholdValue": 120
        },
        "value": 130,
        "status": "KO",
        "error": "maximumBloodPressure_gt_120",
        "message": "minimumBloodPressure' is greater than 120"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

When the handler receives such an event it performs the following operations:

1. add the doctor (`payload.doctorId`) to the list of notification recipients;
2. add the user IDs in the `metadata.includeUsers` field to the recipients list, if present;
3. remove the user IDs in the `metadata.excludeUsers` field from the recipients list, if present;
4. for each recipient:
   1. fetch and merge the notification settings that applies to the given event and participant;
   2. build and send the messages to the participant.

### TMM/TherapyCreated/v1

This event is fired when a new therapy is created in the [TMM][therapy-monitoring-manager] and the event looks like this:

```json
{
  "id": "f303f2e9-f37b-4565-91e4-628e36872df5",
  "key": "high-blood-pressure-therapy-12345",
  "name": "TMM/TherapyCreated/v1",
  "metadata": {
    "includeUsers": ["auth0|anotherDoctorId"],
    "excludeUsers": ["auth0|doctorId"]
  },
  "payload": {
    "planName": "Drug therapy",
    "prototypeId": "medication",
    "startDate": "2022-06-01T00:00:00Z",

    "adherenceStatus": "enabled",
    "adherenceToleranceTime": 1,
    "adherenceMinimumPercentage": 90,
    "complianceStatus": "enabled",
    "complianceMinimumPercentage": 90
  }
}
```

When the handler receives such an event it performs the following operations:

1. fetch the details of the doctor and patient by calling the `getRecipients` utility function and passing the values of the `doctorId` and `patientId` as ids;
2. remove the users in `metadata.excludeUsers` from the participants;
3. add the users in `metadata.includeUsers` to the participants;
4. for each user:
   1. fetch the notification settings by calling the `getNotificationSettings` utility function;
   2. merge the notification settings by calling the `mergeNotificationSettings` utility function;
   3. get the messages to send by calling the `buildMessages` utility function and passing the merged notification settings as argument;
   4. send the messages by calling the `sendMessages` utility function;
   7. compute the first event date according to the therapy plan;
   8. build the reminders by calling `buildReminders`;
   9. schedule the reminders by calling the `setReminders` for the `TMM/TherapyReminder/v1p` event;
   10. merge the user notifications by calling the `mergeNotifications`.

### TMM/TherapyDeleted/v1

When a therapy is deleted the [TMM][therapy-monitoring-manager] sends to the NM a new event named `TMM/TherapyDeleted/v1` that looks like this:

```json
{
  "id": "da03558a-f283-4d9b-b1c7-50282716802c",
  "key": "high-blood-pressure-therapy-12345",
  "name": "TMM/TherapyDeleted/v1",
  "metadata": {
    "excludeUsers": ["lucy.heart"],
    "includeUsers": ["dr.john.watson"]
  },
  "payload": {
    "planName": "Drug therapy",
    "prototypeId": "medication",
    "startDate": "2022-06-01T00:00:00Z",
    "endDate": "2022-06-15T00:00:00Z",
    "each": ["day"],
    "hours": ["10:00"],
    "doctorId": "auth0|doctorId",
    "patientId": "auth0|patientId",
    "adherenceStatus": "enabled",
    "adherenceToleranceTime": 1,
    "adherenceMinimumPercentage": 90,
    "complianceStatus": "enabled",
    "complianceMinimumPercentage": 90,
  }
}
```

When the handler receives such an event it performs the following operations:

1. add the doctor (`payload.doctorId`) and patient (`payload.patientId`) to the list of notification recipients;
2. add the user IDs in the `metadata.includeUsers` field to the recipients list, if present;
3. remove the user IDs in the `metadata.excludeUsers` field from the recipients list, if present;
4. for each user:
    1. fetch the notification settings that apply by calling the `getNotificationSettings` utility function;
    2. merge the notification settings by calling the `mergeNotificationSettings` utility function;
    3. get the messages to send by calling the `buildMessages` utility function;
    4. send the messages by calling the `sendMessages` utility function;
    5. abort all active reminders scheduled when the appointment was created or updated or a recurring reminder was set, by calling the `abortReminders` utility function.

### TMM/TherapyUpdated/v1

This event is fired when a therapy is updated in the [TMM][therapy-monitoring-manager] and the event looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "TMM/TherapyUpdated/v1",
  "metadata": {
    "excludeUsers": ["dr.mario.rossi"],
    "includeUsers": []
  },
  "payload": {
    "originalTherapy": {
      "planName": "Blood pressure therapy",
      "prototypeId": "bloodPressure",
      "notes": "Takes the blood pressure pills",
      "startDate": "2022-06-01T00:00:00Z",
      "endDate": "2022-06-15T00:00:00Z",
      "each": ["day"],
      "times": 2,
      "doctorId": "dr.mario.rossi",
      "patientId": "lucia.viola",
      "adherenceStatus": "enabled",
      "adherenceToleranceFrequency": 1,
      "adherenceMinimumPercentage": 90,
      "complianceStatus": "enabled",
      "complianceMinimumPercentage": 90,
    },
    "currentTherapy": {
      "startDate": "2022-06-01T00:00:00Z",
      "endDate": "2022-07-01T00:00:00Z",
      "each": ["monday", "wednesday", "friday"],
      "doctorId": "dr.andrea.verdi",
      "patientId": "lucia.viola",
      "...": "...",
    }
  }
}
```

The payload must have both the original and the updated version of the therapy plan, in order for the handler to correctly identify the messages to send and the reminders to abort or schedule. In the example above, we are both changing the participants (`doctorId`) and the plan schedule (`endDate`, `each`).

When the handler receives such an event it performs the following operations:

1. cluster the user IDs (`doctorId`, `patientId`) in three groups:
   1. new participants: if the user ID is in the updated therapy, but not in the original;
   2. existing participants: if the user ID is in both the updated and original therapy;
   3. old participants: if the user ID is in the original therapy, but not in the updated version;
2. add the user IDs in the `metadata.includeUsers` field to the list of existing recipients, if present;
3. remove the user IDs in the `metadata.excludeUsers` field from any recipients list, if present;
4. fetch the user details of all the participants;
5. for each new participant, using `TMM/TherapyCreated/v1` as event name and the updated therapy as payload:
   1. fetch and merge the notification settings that applies to the event;
   2. build and send the messages to the participant;
   3. build and schedule all the reminders, using `TMM/TherapyReminder/v1` as reminder event name and the current appointment as payload.
6. for each old participant, using `TMM/TherapyDeleted/v1` as event name and the original therapy as payload:
   1. fetch and merge the notification settings that applies to the event;
   2. build and send the messages to the participant;
   3. abort all active reminders scheduled when the therapy was created or previously updated;
7. for each existing participant:
   1. fetch and merge the notification settings that applies to the given event and participant;
   2. build and send the messages to the participant;
   3. abort all active reminders scheduled when the therapy was created or updated;
   4. build and schedule all the reminders, using `TMM/TherapyReminder/v1` as reminder event name and the current appointment as payload.

The last four steps rely on the [notification utils][custom-handler-api] available in all handlers to perform most of the operations.

### TMM/TherapyReminder/v1

This event is fired when the patient is notified about an ongoing therapy plan in the [TMM][therapy-monitoring-manager] and the event looks like this:

```json
{
  "id": "06efe38d-0e46-4863-9bb4-4c11ff63c912",
  "key": "blood-pressure-therapy-12345",
  "metadata": {
    "reminder": {
      "schedule": "PT1H",
      "expirationDate": "2022-06-04T23:00:00Z",
      "recipients": ["jill.marlowe"]
    }
  },
  "name": "TMM/TherapyReminder/v1",
  "payload": {
    "planName": "High blood pressure therapy",
    "prototypeId": "bloodPressure",
    "notes": "Takes the blood pills",
    "startDate": "2022-06-01T00:00:00Z",
    "endDate": "2022-06-15T00:00:00Z",
    "each": ["day"],
    "times": 2,
    "doctorId": "dr.mark.greene",
    "patientId": "jill.marlowe",
    "adherenceStatus": "enabled",
    "adherenceToleranceFrequency": 1,
    "adherenceMinimumPercentage": 90,
    "complianceStatus": "enabled",
    "complianceMinimumPercentage": 90,
  }
}
```

This handler automatically schedules the next reminder in the same way of the [TMM/MonitoringReminder/v1][tmm-monitoring-reminder] event handler.

When the handler receives such an event it performs the following operations:

1. add the user IDs from the reminder recipients (`metadata.reminder.recipients`) to the list of notification recipients;
2. for each recipient:
   1. fetch and merge the notification settings that apply to the given event and user;
   2. filter the notification settings whose `reminders` field contains the reminder schedule (`metadata.reminders.schedule`);
   3. build and send the messages to the participant;
   4. build and schedule the next reminders, according to the notification settings and using the same event.
