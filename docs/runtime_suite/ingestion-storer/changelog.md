## [1.5.2] - 2023-10-23

### Added

- introduce support for `snappy` compression in Java native image
- introduce environment variable `JAVA_OPTS` for configuring native image parameters

### Changed

- updated Docker image employed for build and runtime stages

## [1.5.1] - 2023-10-05

### Fixed

- An incoming Kafka message with `null` key is now handled correctly

## [1.5.0] - 2023-08-10

### Added

- messages are cached until they reach a tunable size and then uploaded
- cached messages are always uploaded after a tunable timeout to reach `lag=0` on topics
- introduced config key `bss.cache-upload-timeout` which controls `lag=0` policy timeout
- introduced config key `bss.max-bytes-per-file` (default 8MB) to establish the average file size to upload. Setting `0` recovers `v1.4.0` behavior.
- introduced config key `bss.max-cache-size` (default 10MB)

### Fixed

- kafka consumer, event producer and reingestion producer are functioning java beans
- introduced missing shutdown logic
- kafka deserializer is ByteArrayDeserializer (no content knowledge of messages payload or key is needed here)
- log levels of internal libraries `com.google.api.client`, `org.apache.kafka.common`, `io.netty.buffer`, and `io.opencensus` lifted to WARN

## [1.4.0] - 2023-06-28

### Added

- new configuration parameter `bucket-folder` for each ingestion topic, which allows to customize the folder where topic messages are stored

### Fixed
