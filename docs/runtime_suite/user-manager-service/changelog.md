### BREAKING CHANGES

- This version contains changes to the error objects.
This new format can be breaking if your microservices are explicitly using the old error objects content.
- This version requires at least v4.3.0 of crud service since we are using the query parameter `_rawp` in the
user manager service (see [here](../crud-service/overview_and_usage#return-a-subset-of-properties) for further information).
- The userinfo additional properties are now handled via the `USERINFO_ADDITIONAL_PROPERTIES` environment variable.
Additional properties via configuration file are no longer available.
