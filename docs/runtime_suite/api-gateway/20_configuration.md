The service is based on Nginx, so to write the various configuration files we demand to its [official documentation](https://nginx.org/en/docs/).  

## Environment Variables

This API Gateway service does not have any environment variables.

## Configuration Directories

The API Gateway service needs four configuration directories to work:

- default.d: This folder contains the four standard upstream definitions, and can be used for adding future
    default upstream definitions that can be used by the various clients of the platform.
- conf.d: This folder can contain every import statement that must be added to the main http statement,
    this can include additional server statements, upstream definition, and mapping functions.
- platform.d: This folder will be imported in the frontend server statement and contains
    all the locations statement and header definitions.
- backoffice.d: This folder will be imported in the backend server statement and contains
    all the locations statement and header definitions and must proxy pass all the unhandled path to the frontend.
