The Mockoon Mock Service plugin is a simple plugin that relies on the [Mockoon CLI](https://mockoon.com/cli/) to launch a mock server.

The interface exposed by the mock server is defined by means of a simple JSON file which you can produce by hand or by means of the [Mockoon Desktop App](https://mockoon.com/download/).

The Mockoon Mock Service is very simple to configure and it's useful in all those cases in which you need a mock server inside your project.
