_Fast Data Control Plane_ is an application designed to manage the runtime deployment of Fast Data within a Kubernetes environment, using the [Runtime Management](/fast_data/runtime_management/overview.mdx) suite.

:::tip
Check the [Runtime Management](/fast_data/runtime_management/overview.mdx) documentation for more information on its features and how to use the Control Plane frontend.
:::

Its core functionality includes the ability to alter, store, and reset the runtime state of microservices that constitute Mia-Platform Fast Data solution.

:::note
Check the [Control Plane Configuration](/fast_data/runtime_management/control_plane.mdx) documentation for more information on how to configure the Control Plane application.

## Resources

With the Marketplace application you will have all the required resources to start using Runtime Management.

### Microservices

The application will create (or use if already been defined) the following microservices:

- [Envoy API Gateway](/runtime_suite/envoy-api-gateway/overview.md)
- [Control Plane backend](/fast_data/runtime_management/control_plane.mdx), having a gRPC full-duplex connection channel
- [Control Plane frontend](/fast_data/runtime_management/control_plane_frontend.mdx), used by the end-user to interact with the Control Plane 

### Config Maps

The application will create a Config Map (named `control-plane-configuration` by default) having the following JSON configuration file.

```json title={configuration.json}
{
  "runtime": {
    "feedback": {
      "type": "grpc"
    },
    "state": {
      "type": "grpc"
    }
  },
  "persistence": {
    "type": "mongodb",
    "configuration": {
      "url": "{{MONGODB_URL}}"
    },
    "collection": {
      "name": "{{MONGODB_COLLECTION}}"
    }
  }
}
```

### Endpoints

The following endpoints will be attached to the API Gateway:

- `/`: which will redirect to the Control Plane frontend;
- `/fast-data` where the Control Plane backend will be exposed

### Secure Access

If you want to setup Control Plane with authorization and authentication mechanisms, there is a dedicated application.

To learn more about it, you can visit [its own documentation page](/fast_data/runtime_management/secure_access.md).
