In order to simplify the creation of a new Mongo-based [Files Service](../../runtime_suite/files-service/configuration#mongodb-gridfs-configuration-file-single-bucket-option) instance, this application available in the Marketplace will help you configure all the needed resources in a few clicks.

:::tip
This application may come in handy when adding files-related capabilities to a [Microfrontend Composer](../../microfrontend-composer/overview).
:::

##Â Usage

It is recommended to check the documentation page for the [Files Service Plugin](../../runtime_suite/files-service/configuration) for detailed information on how to use the component.

:::caution
This application comes with a default incomplete ConfigMap for the Files Service, specifying Mongo as storage service. For detailed information on how to write a proper ConfigMap, please refer to the Files Service Plugin [documentation page](../../runtime_suite/files-service/configuration#configuration-file).
:::

## Microservices

The application consists of the following microservices:

- [Files Service](../../runtime_suite/files-service/configuration#configuration-file) to manage files.
- [CRUD Service](../../runtime_suite/crud-service/overview_and_usage) to store files information in a [pre-configured](../../runtime_suite/files-service/configuration#crud-collection) collection called `file_records`.

## Endpoints

The application exposes the Files Service on the `/files-service` endpoint.
