In order to simplify the creation of a new Mongo-based 
[Files Service](runtime_suite/files-service/configuration#mongodb-gridfs-configuration-file-single-bucket-option) 
instance, this application available in the Marketplace will help you configure all the needed resources in a few clicks.

:::tip
This application may come in handy when adding files-related capabilities to a [Backoffice](business_suite/backoffice/overview).
:::

## Usage

It is recommended to check the documentation page for the [Files Service Plugin](runtime_suite/files-service/configuration)
for detailed information on how to use the component.

:::caution
This application comes with a default incomplete ConfigMap for the Files Service, specifying Mongo as storage service.
For detailed information on how to write a proper ConfigMap, please refer to the Files Service Plugin 
[documentation page](runtime_suite/files-service/configuration#configuration-file).
:::

## Microservices

The application consists of the following microservices:

- [Files Service](runtime_suite/files-service/configuration#configuration-file) to manage files.
- [CRUD Service](runtime_suite/crud-service/overview_and_usage) to store files information in
  a [pre-configured](runtime_suite/files-service/configuration#crud-collection) collection
  called `file_records`.

## Endpoints

The application exposes the Files Service on the `/files-service` endpoint.
