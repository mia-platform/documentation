The configuration of the application is pretty straight forward. You just need to follow the wizard and choose for each service if you want to deploy a new resource or link an existing one.

Your new frontend instance will be exposed under `/mfe-application`, but you can always change that in the endpoints section.

## Architecture

All the resources needed for the frontend are available through a _single pod_, that contains a [micro-lc config server](https://micro-lc.io/add-ons/backend/middleware). This server is responsible for exposing both micro-lc entrypoint (`index.html` file) and configurations, while the other components (micro-lc itself, the layout components, and back-kit components library) are **sourced from a CDN**

Four config maps are mounted on the config server with just enough to spawn a functioning frontend instance.

- `micro-lc-static-files` with the `index.html` micro-lc entrypoint,
- `micro-lc-configurations` with micro-lc configuration files,
- `micro-lc-server-configuration` with the configuration file of the server itself, and
- `micro-lc-assets` with any other static file you wish to serve.

Apart from `micro-lc-assets`, the config maps are marked as readonly since they are meant to be managed through the [Microfrontend Composer](/microfrontend-composer/composer/structure) Console section.

The content of `micro-lc-static-files` and `micro-lc-assets` is exposed through `/mfe-application` endpoint, while configuration files (the content of `micro-lc-configurations`) is exposed through `/micro-lc-configurations` endpoint.

:::caution
If you wish to change endpoints, pay attention to path rewrites: the endpoint exposing static files needs to be rewritten to `/public`, while the one exposing configurations needs to be rewritten to `/configurations`.
