In order to simplify the creation of a new [Backoffice](../../business_suite/backoffice/overview)
instance, this application available in the Marketplace will help you configure all the needed resources in a few clicks.
No resources are fetched from cross origins, making this application suitable when the target environment cannot reach a
public CDN service.

:::caution
This application is meant to be used with the 
[Backoffice Configurator](../../business_suite/backoffice-configurator/overview). For this
reason, you will find that almost all the default config maps are _readonly_.
