In order to simplify the creation of Microfrontend Composer](../../microfrontend-composer/overview), this application available in the Marketplace will help you configure all the needed resources in a few clicks. No resources are fetched from cross origins, making this application suitable when the target environment cannot reach a public CDN service.

:::caution
This application is meant to be used with the [Composer](../../microfrontend-composer/composer/structure). For this reason, you will find that almost all the default config maps are _readonly_.
