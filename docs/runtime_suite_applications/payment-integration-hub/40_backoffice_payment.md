The Payment Integration Hub provides already configured pages that allow to perform actions on payments and includes customizable dashboards to monitor custom payment KPIs.

The pages are fully customizable, and they can be modified to implement new functionalities and adapt to specific needs; for more details on how to configure the pages you can refer to [Microfrontend Composer documentation](../../microfrontend-composer/back-kit/overview).

The complete configuration of all pages is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Mia-FinTech/payment-backoffice#--backoffice-templates---payment).
It is also possible to define them as templates in your own project following this [guide](../../microfrontend-composer/composer/configurator_settings#template-sources), the URL to insert is `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mia-FinTech/payment-backoffice/main/`.

:::note
The Backoffice is not included by default in the Payment Integration Hub Application.

:::note
A set of ready to use configuration for MongoDB View, that make your data available to the backoffice, are available in the [configuration section](./50_configuration.md#view).
