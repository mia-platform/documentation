## Console

### Bug Fix

#### Update data in Endpoints section

Fixed problems that prevented a user to update some values in endpoint settings, in particular:
* "Show in API Portal";
* "Support only JSON format on request";
* "Force the endpoint to pass through the Microservice Gateway";
* "Support only JSON format on response";
* "Timeout";
* "Rate limit"; 
* "Request body size limit";

## How to update your Console

For on-premise Console installations, please contact your Mia Platform referent to know how to use the `Helm chart version 8.1.2`.
