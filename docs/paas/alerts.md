Mia-Platform PaaS Monitoring defines a set of alerting rules by default. Currently you cannot add custom alerting rules.

These rules refer to Kubernetes cluster, Kafka, Prometheus and AlertManager. They can have 3 severity levels: info, warning and critical.

This is a list with all the alerts, severity and description:  


|                 **Alert**                 | **Severity** | **Description** |
| ------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| AlertmanagerClusterCrashlooping                 | Half or more of the Alertmanager instances within the same cluster are crashlooping. Alerts could be notified multiple time unless pods are crashing to fast and no alerts can be sent.                   | critical             |
| AlertmanagerClusterDown                         | Half or more of the Alertmanager instances within the same cluster are down.                                                                                                                              | critical             |
