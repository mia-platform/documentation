When designing your Project in the Mia-Platform Console, you can define and configure [Custom Resources](/console/design-your-projects/custom-resources/custom-resources.md), either from scratch or from the existing resources already included in the Marketplace. Here we explain how you can add your own Custom Resources to the Marketplace.

Custom Resources are basically defined by two fields:

- the `apiVersion` field, which should be set to `custom-generator.console.mia-platform.eu/v1` for generic template-based Custom Resources, or to the version of the Kubernetes API used by the resource in case of Kubernetes-specific Custom Resources
- the `kind` field, which is the specific resource type of the resource

A Custom Resource can be created from scratch or from an existing Marketplace item and added to your Project. Custom Resources on the Marketplace follow the base Marketplace item schema defined in the ["Create your Company Marketplace" page](/marketplace/add_to_marketplace/create_your_company_marketplace.md#how-to-configure-a-new-item), with the _type_ field set to `custom-resource`.

Custom resource items in the Marketplace also support _versioning_, allowing you to update a resource without overwriting its previous versions. 

## Custom Resource definition

The following JSON Schema can be used to create a Marketplace item with _type_ `custom-resource`.

This schema can be used to define both available types of Custom Resources: generic **template-based** Custom Resources, and **Kubernetes-specific** ones.

Here is an example of a template-based Custom Resource:

<details>
<summary>ExternalOrchestratorLambda</summary>
<p>

```yaml
name: ExternalOrchestratorLambda
meta:
    kind: ExternalOrchestratorLambda
    apiVersion: custom-generator.console.mia-platform.eu/v1
spec:
  code: the code
generator:
  type: template
  configurationBaseFolder: base-folder-name
  templates:
    - template: this template can take some values from the spec, such as %spec.code%
      name: template-name
      fileExtension: json # default is yaml
      folderName: template-folder-name
```

</p>
</details>

Here is an example of a Kubernetes-specific Custom Resource, used to configure [`kube-green`](https://kube-green.dev/):

<details>
<summary>SleepInfo</summary>
<p>

```yaml
name: sleepInfo
meta:
    apiVersion: kube-green.com/v1alpha1
    kind: SleepInfo
spec:
    sleepAt: "20:00"
    timeZone: Europe/Rome
    weekdays: "1-5"
```

</p>
</details>

## Create a new Custom Resource

::: info
In the following paragraphs, we are going to use the `miactl` tool to create a new Custom Resource.

Make sure to [configure miactl](/cli/miactl/20_setup.md) before proceeding with the next steps.
:::

### Define the new Marketplace item

First of all, we need to create a new file that includes the Marketplace item information and the Custom Resource that we want to add.

Here is an example of Marketplace item definition for a template-based Custom Resource:

<details>
<summary>template-custom-resource.yaml</summary>
<p>

```yaml
name: Google Cloud Function External
description: Google Function Template with external repository handled by Developer Team
type: custom-resource
tenantId: my-company-id
itemId: google-function-external-template
image:
  localPath: ../../images/google-cloud-functions.png
supportedByImage:
  localPath: ../../images/mia-platform-logo.png
categoryId: serverless
version:
  name: 1.0.0
  releaseNote: Initial release
resources:
  meta:
    apiVersion: custom-generator.console.mia-platform.eu/v1
    kind: GoogleFunctionTemplateGenerator
  name: my-google-function
  spec:
    targetRuntime: nodejs20.x
    helloMessage: Say hello from your Cloud Function
    targetRepositoryId: 1234
  generator:
    configurationBaseFolder: googlecloudfunctions
    templates:
      - name: configs
        template: |
          TARGET_RUNTIME=%spec.targetRuntime%
          HELLO_MESSAGE=%spec.helloMessage%
          TARGET_REPOSITORY_ID=%spec.targetRepositoryId%
        fileExtension: env
    type: template
```

</p>
</details>

Here is an example of Marketplace item definition for a Kubernetes-specific Custom Resource:

<details>
<summary>k8s-custom-resource.yaml</summary>
<p>

```yaml
name: Traefik IngressRoute
description: The configuration of the IngressRoute resource for Traefik
type: custom-resource
tenantId: my-company-id
itemId: traefik-ingressroute
imageUrl: imageUrl.png
supportedByImageUrl: supportedByImageUrl.png
supportedBy: my-company-id
categoryId: kubernetes-custom-resource
version:
  name: 1.0.0
  releaseNote: Initial release
documentation:
  type: externalLink
  url: https://docs.mia-platform.eu/docs/infrastructure/paas/tools/traefik#expose-an-endpoint
resources:
  name: default
  meta:
    apiVersion: traefik.io/v1alpha1
    kind: IngressRoute
  labels:
    - name: app.kubernetes.io/instance
      value: ingress-controller
  spec:
    entryPoints:
      - websecure
    routes:
      - match: Host(`{{PROJECT_HOST}}`)
        kind: Rule
        services:
        - name: api-gateway
          port: 8080
```

</p>
</details>

Please note that:

- the `type: custom-resource` is required to specify that this resource is a Custom Resource
- the `version` property is included, to define this item as a version `1.0.0` with a specific release note: versions are not mandatory but highly suggested to avoid overwriting existing resources.

### Publish the new Custom Resource

To upload the resource to the Marketplace, run the following command, specifying the file name and your Company (tenant) id:

```bash
> miactl marketplace apply -f ./my-custom-resource.yaml --company-id my-company-id
```

You should receive a success response similar to this one:

```bash
1 of 1 items have been successfully applied:

  OBJECT ID                 ITEM ID             STATUS   

  66423781fdd3d6dd3ca62b7b  my-custom-resource  Created 
```

You just created your custom resource, which is now available on your `Company Marketplace`.

### Update the Custom Resource

You can update a Custom Resource Marketplace item by using the same `miactl marketplace apply` command explained before, by including an updated file (either in `json` or `yaml` format).

When updating a Custom Resource, it is recommended to create a new version of the Marketplace item to avoid overwriting the existing one. The new version should contain the updated resource definition and a release note detailing the changes.

In case you are trying to update a versioned Marketplace Custom Resource, remember that only few fields can be modified.
For more information, refer to the [dedicated section on the "Create your Company Marketplace" page](/marketplace/add_to_marketplace/create_your_company_marketplace.md#editing-a-versioned-resource).

#### Update non-versioned Custom Resources

In case the Custom Resource you need to update is not versioned, you can update it by using the `miactl marketplace apply` command, passing the company id (`tenantId` of your resource) and the resource file you created before with the modifications you need.

Since this is a non-versioned element, all field values can be updated without limitations. However, please make sure to use the same `itemId` and the same `tenantId` of the resource you want to update.

In case you lost the original resource file (or simply you do not have it anymore), you can retrieve it from the Marketplace by using the `miactl marketplace get` command:

```bash
miactl marketplace get --object-id 66423781fdd3d6dd3ca62b7b > my-custom-resource.yaml
```

You can use the result as a template to modify the resource you want to update.
