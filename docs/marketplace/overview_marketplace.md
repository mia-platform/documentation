This section provides documentation for the available **runtime components** that can be used within your projects on Mia-Platform Console.

Runtime components are ready-to-use building blocks that can be added to your projects directly from the **Console Design area**, thanks to a guided UI that simplifies setup and configuration.
Each component is designed to solve specific runtime needs, from service communication to data processing, and is built to integrate seamlessly with the Mia-Platform ecosystem.

All components are maintained by **Mia-Platform** or trusted **technology partners**, and are published in the public ðŸ‘‰ [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mia-platform-marketplace/public-catalog)

### Want to propose a change or add a new item?

All updates must go submitted via a Pull Request (PR) on the [public-catalog](https://github.com/mia-platform-marketplace/public-catalog) repository â€” ensuring transparency and consistency across the Catalog.

Explore the sections below to discover whatâ€™s available and how to use each component effectively.
