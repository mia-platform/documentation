Mia-Platform Console comes with a self-managed license tracking mechanism, that measures Console usage on a timely base.

The data is collected by querying the cluster directly for information in a time period specified within this configuration in the `scheduleEveryMinutes` field.

:::info
In order to reach the Kubernetes clusters the license tracking system will use the service accounts configured in your Company for each Cluster; make sure these service account have the following permissions described [here](../../../../development_suite/clusters-management/cluster-setup).
:::

:::note
The license tracking system is enabled by default, however if your contract allows for it you can shut it down or tune it with a different time schedule.
