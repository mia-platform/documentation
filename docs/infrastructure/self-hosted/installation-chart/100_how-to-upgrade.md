In order to upgrade Mia-Platform Console, all you need to do is to update the `mia-console` Chart version dependency in your `Chart.yaml`Â file.

:::tip
When upgrading Mia-Platform Console to a new major release, always remember that updates must be performed one major at a time. Therefore, in order to upgrade from v10 to v12 you must first upgrade to the latest v11 version.

To find out how to upgrade your installation to the latest version of v11, visit the [following documentation](../../../12.x/infrastructure/self-hosted/installation-chart/how-to-upgrade).
:::

```yaml title="Chart.yaml" {9} showLineNumbers
apiVersion: v2
name: console
version: "0.0.0"
kubeVersion: ">= 1.20.0"
description: Self Hosted Console Installation Chart
type: application
dependencies:
  - name: mia-console
    version: "X.Y.Z"
    repository: "https://nexus.mia-platform.eu/repository/helm-internal/"
```

When upgrading also make sure to check if any new configuration option is available or if something has been removed.

:::info
The Chart version follows [semver](https://semver.org/) policy so any breaking change with the Chart will always be followed by a Major release. Minor releases may include new configuration options while as a general rule of thumb, patches never holds new configuration options but only internal updates and fixes.
