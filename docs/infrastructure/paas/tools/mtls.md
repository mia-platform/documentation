If you need mTLS support in one or more of your projects and you have a dedicated cluster on the Mia-Platform PaaS,
you can request to enable in your cluster a service mesh provider choosing between:

- [Istio]
- [Linkerd]

To request the installation of the provider you must open a service request through our [portal].  
You can request to enable one or more projects inside the mesh network with mTLS enabled.
You can ask only for project already created inside the console,
so for new and future projects you need to open a new request every time you want to add them inside the mesh.  
The projects can be empty at the time of the requests so you donâ€™t need a fully working project deployed
in every environment before asking.
