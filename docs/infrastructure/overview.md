Mia-Platform can be adopted in three different ways, according to your needs:

- **SaaS**: we manage the tools, you bring your own infrastructure and providers (Git, pipelines, secret manager, etc.).
- **PaaS**: we take care of everything.
- **On-Premises**: install it wherever you want.

The SaaS distribution is the most widely adopted by our customers. Our team will assist and guide you during the onboarding process.

Please refer to the [PaaS section](/paas/overview.md) and [On-Premises section](/self_hosted/self_hosted_requirements.md) to get all the information about these distribution models.
