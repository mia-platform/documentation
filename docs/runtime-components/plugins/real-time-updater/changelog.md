## [7.11.2] 2025-02-18

### Fixed

-`fast-data-automation-lib` to `v3.1.6`: Removed p-limit on strategies since when limit was reached the service got blocked in an infinite wait

## [7.11.1] 2025-02-06

### Fixed

-`kafka-importer-lib` to `v7.10.2`: When operations were not executed in order some strategies were being skipped. Now only the right strategies are skipped.

## [7.11.0] 2025-01-23

### Added

- `forceResume` setting field to `controlPlane.settings.channel` that can either be a boolean or an object with a numeric field `timeout.ms`, defining the amount of time for control plane pipelines to be resumed after an unsuccessful connection.

### Changed

- `controlPlane.settings` object now has both `state` and `feedback` marked as optional

### Removed

- `gRPC` Control Plane Feedback client
- `Kafka` Control Plane client

## [7.10.0] 2025-01-16

### Fixed

- Reconnect Control Plane GRPC client when Control Plane Operator restarts

### Added

- `PRODUCER_MAX_BATCH_SIZE` environment to set the number of messages of each kafka producer's batch. Defaults to 500. 

## [7.9.1] 2024-12-05

### Added

- Added image signing and sbom generation in pipeline

## [7.9.0] 2024-07-29

### Added

- Add `DELETE_MECHANISM` env var to control hard/soft delete behavior

### Fixed

- `USE_UPSERT` is overwritten to true when message adapter is `db2` or `basic` since the DB2 message does not contain operation type info

## [7.8.0] 2024-06-06

### Added

- 
  - support for new cast function signature, that is:
    ```js
    export default function(messageObject, fieldName, logger) {
      const myValue = messageObject[fieldName]
      // do some custom logic...
      return myValue
    }
    ```
  - kafka message adapter can be loaded as ESM modules, for example:
    ```js
    export default function myEsmMessageAdapter(message, primaryKeys, logger) {
      // ...adapter logic
    }
    ```

## [7.7.0] 2024-04-23

### Updated

- **control plane** connection, which can be configured also using [gRPC protocol](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/introduction/) supported by control plane backend. 

  Two possible configurations can be set over the JSON file located at the path specified by `CONTROL_PLANE_CONFIG_PATH`:
  - `full-duplex`: the service will open a bidirectional streaming channel to send its state and receive updates
    ```json
    {
      "feedback": {
        "type": "grpc"
      },
      "state": {
        "type": "grpc"
      },
      "settings": {
        "channel": {
          // interval for which service will send its state
          // defaults to 2500ms if not specified
          "heartbet.ms": 2500 
        },
        "grpc": {
          // tells the service the hostname of your control plane istance
          "host": "your-control-plane-host",
          // port where the service is exposed, defaults to grpc default 50051
          "port": 50051 
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  - `feedback-only`: the service will open a request streaming channel to send its state, while the control plane will send updates using a kafka topic
    ```json
    {
      "feedback": {
        "type": "grpc"
      },
      "state": {
        "type": "kafka",
        "configuration": { /** kafka connection configuration */ }
      },
      "settings": { /** same as full-duplex */ }
    }
    ```
### Fixed

- bug that prevented health probes to work properly if control plane was not configured

## [7.6.0] 2024-04-11

### Added

* **control plane feature**, where:
  * ingestion topics can paused/resumed over commands sent by the control plane service. 
  * the service updates periodically the control-plane state about the state of its topics.
  
To enable these features, the following environment variables are needed:

  * `CONTROL_PLANE_CONFIG_PATH`: absolute path of the JSON file containing the connection details to the control plane.
  * `CONTROL_PLANE_BINDINGS_PATH`: absolute path of the JSON file containing the link between control plane artifacts and ingestion topics. This file is auto-generated by Mia Console.

For more details on how to configure the control plane, visit its [dedicated section](/products/fast_data/runtime_management/overview.mdx)  

### Updated

* `kafka-importer-lib` to `v7.6.0`: control plane features and fix to have a limit of 500 messages in a `pr-update` batch.

## [7.5.8] 2024-02-13

### Added

* add `PRODUCER_COMPRESSION` environment variable, to enable the encoding of kafka pr-update messages with the following encoding standards:
  - `snappy`
  - `gzip`
  - `none` (__default__ if no value has been provided)

### Updated

* `kafka-importer-lib` to `v7.5.8`: pr-update messages are now sent in batch, instead of one message per update

## [7.5.7] 2023-12-15

### Fixed

- improved some logging (upgraded `fast-data-automation-lib` to `v3.1.4`)
- when using `db2` (`basic`) or `debezium` message adapter the service
is now able to properly process messages whose payload is empty (a buffer with length of zero), instead of skipping them

### Added

- documentation folder

### Changed

- updated Node JS to v20
- updated service demo
- updated `kafka-importer-lib` to `v7.5.7`

## [7.5.6] 2023-09-07

### Fixed

- Strategies not executed when message has old timestamp (__internal__counter)

### Updated

- updated `kafka-importer-lib` to `v7.5.5`

## [7.5.5] 2023-07-21

### Added

- added a docker-compose file and an example of configuration, which allows to automatically configure a demo of the Real-Time Updater
- added a Makefile to simplify the interaction with docker-compose and starting tests using dependencies defined in the docker-compose

### Changed

- updated kafka-importer-lib to include the kafka consumer metrics tracking logic
- updated NodeJS image to v18.17.0 in Dockerfile
- updated the README to provide some insights on the RTU demo
- `db2` can be used now as alias of `basic` when selecting the message adapter 

## [7.5.4] 2023-06-26

### Fixed

- upgrade `kafka-importer-lib` to `v7.5.3` to fix the logic handling Debezium tombstone messages

## [7.5.3] 2023-06-23

### Fixed

- upgrade `kafka-importer-lib` to `v7.5.2` to fix the Debezium Message Adapter implementation.
Now the Real-Time Updater properly support Debezium CDC change events with and without the change schema.

### Changed

- upgraded `nodejs` image, both in Dockerfile and Gitlab-CI to `v18.16.1`
- upgraded service dependencies

## [7.5.2] 2023-05-25

### Fixed

- `kafkaProjectionUpdates` config map accepts topics without `updatesTopic` property, in the format that the console autogenerates.

## [7.5.1] 2023-05-24

### Fixed

- When strategy throws an error the ingestion message is not committed anymore

## [7.5.0] 2023-03-28

### Added

- Added support for Debezium kafka message adapter

## [7.4.1] 2023-03-14

### Changed

- Re-designed the way the projection changes are stored in mongo: now they get `upserted` with a `bulkWrite` operation instead of doing four separate queries for each projection change. The new way is not based on the existence of a unique index to work properly, like it was with the previous implementation. Introduced with kafka-importer-lib@7.4.1

### Fixed

- Projection changes creation does not depend on collection's unique index anymore, fixing the duplicate projections changes bug

### Added

- Upgraded `fast-data-automation-lib@2.3.5` and added `neededFieldsMap` to the strategy execution to make it compatible with new version and improve performance

## [7.4.0] 2023-02-28

### Added

- `golden-gate` message adapter provides additional operations metadata onto which further logics can be enabled to ensure the correct functioning of the data flow. In particular, the `pos` field (generated by CDC system) is employed by default as value of `operationPosition` property to verify that only _newer_ changes are written to the database. Starting from this release, the `operationPosition` property in `golden-gate` message adapter can also be set to adopt the Kafka message's `timestamp` (as it happens with the other message adapters). This change can be implemented by disabling the default behavior setting the `USE_POS_AS_COUNTER` environment variable to `false`

### Fixed

- fixed a behavior regression that caused the service using this library to restart completely whenever a Kafka consumer rebalance event occurred. Consequently, due to the restarts, more rebalance events were triggered, causing even further restarts that could only be solved by stopping all the services using the same consumer group and starting only one of them.

## [7.3.0] 2023-02-17

### Added

- Added K8s health routes using status exposed by Kafka Importer Lib
- Added `custom-plugin-lib` replacing `k8-patient-lib` with kafka-importer-lib@7.3.0

## [7.2.0] 2023-01-17

### Added
- Add possibility to use [OAuthbearer](https://kafka.js.org/docs/configuration#oauthbearer-example) authentication for connecting to Kafka (only grant type password is supported)

### Changed

- upgrade `kafka-importer-lib` to `v7.2.0` to
  - support OAuthBearer authentication
  - fix a situation where `DELETE` operations of `__records__` with a conflicting `__internal_counter` resulted in writing a new record on the database whose key was null.
    This issue occurred when Real-Time Updater is configured in `upsert` mode. 

## [7.1.5] 2022-12-30

### Changed

- upgrade `kafka-importer-lib` to `v7.1.5` to solve multiple bugs on peculiar service configurations

## [7.1.4] 2022-11-18

### Added

- On error processing the message you can now pause the topic instead of tearing down the service. Added the `PAUSE_TOPIC_CONSUMPTION_ON_ERROR` env var

## [7.1.3] 2022-11-09

- upgrade `kafka-importer-lib` to `v7.1.3` to solve an error during the update of primary keys of type date
