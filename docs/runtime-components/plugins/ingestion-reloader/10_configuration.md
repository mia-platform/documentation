The Ingestion Reloader is one of the Bucket Storage Support components. It is responsible for publishing
on a specified topic one or more events that were previously stored on an external bucket (usually this is achieved via consumed [Ingestion Storer](/products/fast_data/bucket_storage_support/configuration/ingestion_storer.md) plugin).

To learn more about the plugin and its configuration, please navigate to its [documentation](/products/fast_data/bucket_storage_support/configuration/ingestion_reloader.md) in the Fast Data section.
