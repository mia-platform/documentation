`mlp`is a Command Line Interface that is responsible for creating, updating and deleting Kubernetes resources
based on files generated by Mia-Platform Console.  
It can be viewed as a superpowered `kubectl apply` command that introduce additional functionalities to simply sending
patches to the api-server.

`mlp` can prune resources that are not present anymore between different deploys because it keeps an inventory
of all the resources that has applied the last time.  
It can force new deployment rollout even if there are no differences between deploys, running Jobs immediately from
CronJob definitions, and it will add annotations to workload resources about their Secrets and ConfigMaps dependencies.  
The cli will also automatically watch the progression of the applied resources and it will report what and how many
resources failed to reach a ready or successfull state.

In addition `mlp` can also generate ConfigMaps or Secrets via a dedicate configuration file using a combination of
environment variabiles, literal values and files, giving the user the ability to not commiting sensitive data and giving
the ability to use different configuration for different runtime environments.

## Functionalities

- `deploy`: the main command, is used for creating, updating and pruning resources in a kubernetes
	environment using the resource files created by the Mia-Platform Console
- `generate`: create kubernetes `ConfigMap` and `Secret` based on a configuration file
- `hydrate`: is an helper function for configuring correctly the kustomization files inside the target folder
	with all the files and patches found
- `interpolate`: will run through all the files passed and run through a templating function for render the final
	manifests
- `kustomize`: is the same command of `kustomize build` and can be used if you project is using the kustomize structure
	to render the resources to pass to the `interpolate` command

For more information about the various options available to the various commands you can always run
`mlp <command> --help` to see the helpers.
