Although Back-Kit aims to be as agnostic as possible when it comes to custom configurations, a recommended layout might save lots of configuration-related headaches and comes in handy as both an example benchmark and best practice reference. The **recommended** (see a [minimal configuration example](#single-page-configuration)) Back-Kit page layout shall thus have at least:

1. a [bootstrap](#bootstrap-aka-initial-state-injection) manager, whenever some sort of initial state needs to be injected
2. a [data schema](#data-schema), whenever the page has a data source like a database collection/table
3. a collection of web components, including the bootstrap manager

Back-Kit uses the [crud-client] component as **bootstrap manager of choice**. This is fairly standard on a web application that needs a data source and consequent data retrieval pretty much at the beginning of its state lifecycle.

:::info
Bootstrap shall be used by any web component taking initial state from the page URL.
:::

Data schema is a JSON-schema, directly plugged into the configuration, describing how to **fetch data**, which **projection** use, whether **sorting** is needed, how to **render data** on CRUD operations (within forms, drawers, delete buttons and so on). Data Schema can be used by web components that support it as a tag property.

## Bootstrap (a.k.a. initial state injection)

When a configuration is rendered, some initial state may be encoded into the page URL. Bootstrap refers thus to the process of reading the URL and distributing state to components that need it and then start the web application. This behavior allows landing on a page with a given customized setup on top of the configuration. Roughly, configuration overrides web components defaults while bootstrapping customizes a page instance.

Most common initial states provide initial pagination, components to be focused, text to be inserted on inputs. Some components might require bootstrap, but it is not a mandatory feature for components to have.

Bootstrapping a page entails three main phases:

1. components read the URL parsing properties related to their initial state. Components then evolves without changing properties becoming React-alike [controlled components](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components)
2. components modify their internal state and, if needed, emit an event
3. a single component, the bootstrap manager, typically the [crud-client], is then tasked with awaiting events triggered by applying the initial state. Such component must have a debounce time after which it ends bootstrapping whether it received bootstrap events.

Bootstrapping from a client makes sense since most of the time the side effect first task of a frontend page is loading data from a source. Initial state may  or may not refine such data retrieval applying filters or pagination. After initial state is shared data can be collected.

## Data Schema

A web application that employs Back-Kit web components is very likely to model a data collection and/or enrich it with lookups from other collections. A fairly standard use case would be a page rendering a table whose content is given by a MongoDB collection.

Components **must be aware of an existing data schema** which instructs on what to show in the webpage and how to show it.

:::caution
Back-Kit components pass the data schema to components via the tag property `dataSchema`.
:::

A data schema is thus encoded as a [JSON-schema](https://json-schema.org/specification.html) with several extensions to keep track of what rendering components might need.

The outer structure requires a data schema to be an `object`, containing an `object` of `properties` that could in return be marked as `required`

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "_id": {
      ...
    },
    "__STATE__": {
      ...
    },
    ...
    "ingredients": {

    }
  },
  "required": ["_id", "__STATE__"]
}
```

This layout more or less matches a collection/table schema. The `required` property list only those entries/properties that **must** be defined whenever there is an attempt to create a new item on the collection represented by the schema.

:::caution
Remind that `CRUD services` might implement automatic creation strategies on items properties, like unique ID automatic generation and non-null default values. It might be dangerous to let those values be set by a user. They instead can be marked [hidden](#visualization-options).
:::

:::caution
Since `crud-service` implements its own patch strategy for the `__STATE__` param (i.e. posts on the collection row), data schema config must exclude unintended patches on that field. To do so a generic configuration might include in data schema `__STATE__` property the option

```json
{
  "__STATE__": {
    ...,
    "formOptions": {
      "hiddenOnSelect": true
    }
  }
}
```

:::

A property needs specifications about formatting and viewing

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "email": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "uri",
      "order": 2,
      ...
    },
    "__STATE__": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["PUBLIC", "DRAFT", "TRASH"],
      "order": 0,
      "label": {
        "en": "Item State",
        "it": "Stato dell'articolo",
        "zh": "物品状态",
        ...
      },
      "formOptions": {
        ...
      },
      "visualizationOptions": {
        ...
      },
      "lookupOptions": {
        ...
      }
    },
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

A `label` is either a `string` or a [LocalizedText][localized-text] and provides a label for a given property.

An `order` is number that allow to customize the order in which items are rendered by data visualization components.

A `type` is a [JSON-schema version 7 type](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/type.html).

### Formats

On top of types, extra information can be passed to better understand how a property needs to be shown, i.e. a `string` could be a `password` or a `date`, an `object` could be a plain JavaScript `object` or maybe a `file`. To achieve that, components refer to the `format` key which is not mandatory and when absent triggers defaulting behavior on the type specified by `type`.

| type         | formats                                                                                                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `string`     | `date`, `date-time`, `time`, `email`, `uri`, `regex`, `password`, `text-area`, `lookup` (__deprecated__), `editor` |
| `number`     | `date`, `date-time`, `time` , `currency`                                                                           |
| `integer`    | -                                                                                                                  |
| `object`     | `file`, `localized-text`, `geopoint`, `lookup`                                                                     |
| `array`      | `file`, `multilookup` (__deprecated__), `geopoint`, `lookup`                                                       |
| `boolean`    | -                                                                                                                  |
| `form-addon` | `link`, `title`, `subtitle`                                                                                        |
| `null`       | -                                                                                                                  |

The `format` may be picked by components to provide better UI rendering choices on a given `type`. Components such as the [Table][bk-table] or the [Dynamic Form Modal][bk-dynamic-form-modal] make extensive use of formats.

When `type` is set to `string`, the extra key `enum` is available to specify available text entries. `enum` key accepts either an array of strings or an array of objects with keys `id`, `label`. `id` is the actual datum (thus should be a string), while `label` is its [i18n][localized-text] representation, supported by most components (such as the Table or the [Dynamic Form Modal][bk-dynamic-form-modal]).

For instance:
```json
{
  "weekDay": {
    "type": "string",
    "enum": [
      {"id": "mon", "label": {"en": "Monday", "it": "Lunedì"}},
      {"id": "tue", "label": {"en": "Tuesday", "it": "Martedì"}},
      {"id": "wed", "label": {"en": "Wednesday", "it": "Merdoledì"}},
      {"id": "thu", "label": {"en": "Thursday", "it": "Giovedì"}},
      {"id": "fri", "label": {"en": "Friday", "it": "Venerdì"}}
    ]
  }
}
```

When `type` is set to `string` or `number` and the format is set to one of `date`, `date-time`, `time`, the extra key `dateOptions` is available and holds a `displayFormat` property which allows customization of date visualization format. Back-Kit components handles dates and timestamps using [dayjs](https://day.js.org/) library and its [parsing/formatting syntax](https://day.js.org/docs/en/parse/string-format). If `type` is `number` the datum is expected to be a `long` epoch time, and will be converted onto the client/browser according to the timezone specified in `dateOptions.timeZone` (as a TZ database name, for instance "Europe/Rome"), or else as the client/browser timezone. Array of dates are also supported. In this case, the datum can be configured using the `items` key. For instance:

```json
{
  "availabilities": {
    ...
    "type": "array",
    "items": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "date-time",
      "dateOptions": {
        "displayFormat": "DD-MM-YYYY HH:mm",
      }
    }
    ...
  }
}
```

:::note
Please note that the date fields are saved in ISO 8601 format, so it's up to the user to convert them in UTC from its local time before using them in the Appointment Manager.
:::

When `type` is set to `object` and format is `localized-text`, table expects a [localized object][localized-text] and will render the closest language key, i.e. on language `en-US` it will render either `en-US` if available or `en` as a fallback.

Format `geopoint` for fields having `type` set to `array` or `object` allows to visualize geographical coordinates inside a map in forms. With this format, `array` fields must contain exactly two numeric values, indicating latitude and longitude; similarly, `object` fields must contain a field "coordinates" with the latitude and longitude values.

:::caution

`Geopoint` fields within Form components, such as the [Dynamic Form Modal][bk-dynamic-form-modal] or the [Dynamic Form Drawer][bk-dynamic-form-drawer], are rendered using the [leaflet][leaflet] library.
To ensure correct visualization of these fields, it is necessary to update the [Content Security Policy (CSP)][csp] for HTTP calls, allowing the needed retrieval of CSS files and images. The following CSP rules should be appended:

```
style-src https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.8.0/
img-src data:
```

For example, if the plugin orchestration is managed by [micro-lc][micro-lc] (version 2 or higher), additional CSP rules [can be configured][microlc-custom-headers] in its backend thorugh property `publicHeadersMap`. For instance:

```json
{
  "publicHeadersMap": {
    "/public/index.html": {
      "content-security-policy": [
        [
          "script-src 'nonce-**CSP_NONCE**' 'strict-dynamic' 'unsafe-eval'",
          "style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.8.0/",
          "img-src 'self' https: data:",
          "object-src 'none'",
          "font-src 'self'",
          "worker-src 'self' blob:",
          "base-uri 'self'"
        ]
      ],
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

:::

Fields of format `currency` automatically display numeric values according to the specified `template` inside [visualizationOptions](#visualization-options) and [formatOptions](#form-options). By default the value is formatted according to the browser locale (eg the value 1000 will be displayed as `1,000` with english locale), but handlebars helper [nFormat][nformat] is also available.

For instance:
```json
{
  "amount": {
    ...
    "type": "number",
    "format": "currency",
    "formOptions": {
      "template": {
        "en": "$ {{value}}",
        "it": "{{value}} $"
      }
    },
    "visualizationOptions": {
      "template": {
        "en": "$ {{args.[0]}}",
        "it": "{{args.[0]}} $"
      }
    },
    ...
  }
}
```
:::note
In some components, such as the [Table][bk-table], `{{args.[0]}}` corresponds to the value of the current datum.
:::

In order to avoid replication of settings within the same configuration, data schema also carries some component-specific visualization options and/or might require extra data to be fetched.

### Visualization Options

Visualization options concern any web component that is going to render a given dataset represented by the current data schema.

```json
{
  "__STATE__": {
    "type": "string",
    "enum": ["PUBLIC", "DRAFT"],
    ...
    "visualizationOptions": {
      "hidden": false,
      "iconMap": {
        "PUBLIC": {
          "shape": "roundedSquare",
          "color": "#52C41A"
        },
        "DRAFT": {
          "shape": "roundedSquare",
          "color": "#CDCDCE"
        }
      }
    }
    ...
  }
}
```

| `visualizationOptions` option | type                            | description                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hidden`                      | `boolean`                       | whether the property is shown within the form component                                           |
| `hiddenLabel`                 | `boolean`                       | whether the label of the property is shown within the header of the table component               |
| `sortable`                    | `boolean`                       | whether the property can be sorted within the header of the table component                       |
| `iconMap`                     | `object`                        | defines a map of basic shaped icons to be shown with the item and where the key is the item value |
| `template`                    | [LocalizedText][localized-text] | template of how to visualize the value in the cell                                                |
| `joinDelimiter`               | `string`                        | delimiter to visualize array items as a single string                                             |
| `tag`                         | `string`                        | tag to use when embedding a custom component                                                      |
| `properties`                  | { [x: string]: any }            | properties for the embedded custom component                                                      |

| `iconMap` option | values                    | description       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `shape`          | `square`, `roundedSquare` | shape of the icon |
| `color`          | hex color                 | icon color        |


#### Example - template

Example of rendering object and array cells as a string:
```json
{
  "name": {
    ...
    "type": "object",
    "visualizationOptions": {
      "template": "{{name}} {{lastName}}"
    }
  },
  "dishes": {
    ...
    "type": "array",
    "visualizationOptions": {
      "template": "{{[0]}}, {{[1]}}, ..."
    }
  }
}
```

Dynamic values can be specified using handlebars. 

#### Example - custom component

Example of mounting a custom component in the table using `tag`, `properties` keys in visualizationOptions:

```json
{
  "name": {
    ...
    "visualizationOptions": {
      "tag": "bk-button",
      "properties": {
        "content": "{{args.[0]}}",
        "action": {
          "type": "http",
          "config": {
            "url": "/endpoint",
            "body": {
              "riderId": "{{args.[1]._id}}",
              "data": "{{rawObject args.[1]}}"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Dynamic values can be specified using handlebars. `args.[1]` is the object representation of the table row, while `{{args.[0]}}` the value of the cell. If the value of the field should be considered as object, the handlebars helper 'rawObject' can be specified. In the example, key "data" holds an object representation of the whole raw of the table.

:::info
In the example, `{{args.[0]}}` is equivalent to `{{args.[1].name}}`.
:::

For non-nested properties, it is possible to provide a (`template`, `configMap`) pair instead of a value. In such cases, the value of the property is taken from the configMap using template as key (or `$default`, if the template does not match any configMap key). For instance,

```json
{
  "name": {
    ...
    "visualizationOptions": {
      "tag": "bk-button",
      "properties": {
        "content": "{{args.[0]}}",
        "disabled": {
          "template": "{{args.[1].status}}",
          "configMap": {
            "Removed": true,
            "$default": false
          }
        },
        "action": {
          ...
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

the property `disabled` resolves to true in the table rows having field `status` equal to "Removed", false otherwise.

### Form Options

Data visualization and `CRUD` operations might also need a UI component to simplify user interactions with the fetched dataset. This component is often in charge of editing, creating, duplicating, deleting collection items or perform any subset of these actions. Extra options to be specified for user interaction with the dataset should be configured in `formOptions`

```json
{
  ...
  "__STATE__": {
    ...
    "formOptions": {
      "disabled": false,
      "hidden": false,
      "placeholder": "Editable state",
      "readOnly": false
    }
  }
}
```

| options            | type                            | description                                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `disabled`         | boolean                         | whether the property is disabled within the form component              |
| `hidden`           | boolean                         | whether the property is shown within the form component                 |
| `placeholder`      | [LocalizedText][localized-text] | placeholder for the component                                           |
| `readOnly`         | boolean                         | whether the property can be edited                                      |
| `hiddenOnUpdate`   | boolean                         | whether the property is shown within the form component on update       |
| `hiddenOnInsert`   | boolean                         | whether the property is shown within the form component on insert       |
| `readOnlyOnUpdate` | boolean                         | whether the property can be edited on update                            |
| `readOnlyOnInsert` | boolean                         | whether the property can be edited on insert                            |
| `disabledOnUpdate` | boolean                         | whether the property is disabled within the form component on update    |
| `disabledOnInsert` | boolean                         | whether the property is disabled within the form component on update    |
| `showFileInViewer` | boolean                         | whether clicking the file property requests to open the file in browser |
| `template`         | [LocalizedText][localized-text] | template of how to visualize the value in the field                     |

### Filters Options

Extra options to be specified for querying the dataset should be configured in `filtersOptions`

```json
{
  ...
  "__STATE__": {
    ...
    "filtersOptions": {
      "hidden": false,
      "availableOperators": ["equal"]
    }
  }
}
```

| options              | type     | description                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hidden`             | boolean  | whether the property is shown within the filter-drawer and filters-manager components                                       |
| `availableOperators` | string[] | list of [available operators][available-operators] for the field within the the [Filter Drawer][bk-filter-drawer] component |
| `ignoreCase`         | boolean  | controls whether or not equality should be evaluated ignore case. Only applies to string fields                             |

[Filters][filters] with `property` equal to a field with `filtersOptions.hidden` set to true can still be added (for instance, via an [add-filter] event) and effectively query the dataset, but the user will not be able to see or interact with the filter.

### Lookups (__DEPRECATED__)

:::caution
Startin from version 1.4.0 of Back-Kit components, the content of this paragraph is **deprecated**. Support to lookup fields has been integrated within the support for [Views][lookups-from-views].

In order to aggregate data from multiple collections into one, [CRUD Service Views][writable-views] should be used.
:::

Often a dataset has external references. A list of dishes might refer to ingredients picked from its own collection or to a single recipe from a list of recipes. When looking up to other collection a `lookup` refer to a single value that is used instead of the placeholder in the main collection. Whenever a property looks up for an array of values, like dishes with ingredients, it is referred to as `multilookup`.

According to the principle that **a web component does one thing**, a web application willing to resolve lookups must include a client that takes care of that. Back-Kit provides a [Crud Lookup Client][bk-crud-lookup-client] which will set up fetching routes according to data schema `lookupOptions`. So, you need to add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "$ref": {
    "dataSchema": { ... },
  },
  "content": [
    ...,
    {
      "tag": "bk-crud-lookup-client",
      "properties": {
        "basePath": "/v2",
        "dataSchema": {
          "$ref": "dataSchema"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Moreover, a specific set of options must be included into the data schema.  

For instance, if you have a `recipe` field in the main collection, which is an id that refers to an external collection `recipes` and you want to lookup the `name` field, you should use the following configuration:

```json
{
  ...
  "recipe": {
    "type": "string",
    "format": "lookup",
    ...
    "lookupOptions": {
      "lookupDataSource": "recipes",
      "lookupFields": ["name"],
      "lookupValue": "_id"
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

You can also look for more than one field and concatenate the values in a single string with a `lookupDelimiter`:

```json
{
  ...
  "recipe": {
    "type": "string",
    "format": "lookup",
    ...
    "lookupOptions": {
      "lookupDataSource": "recipes",
      "lookupFields": ["name", "author"],
      "lookupDelimiter": " - ",
      "lookupValue": "_id"
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

Concerning multilookups, you can rather use the configuration below. This will lookup, in the `ingredients` table, the array of ingredients that belong to the recipe.

```json
{
  ...
  "ingredients": {
    "type": "array",
    "format": "multilookup",
    ...
    "lookupOptions": {
      "lookupDataSource": "ingredients",
      "lookupFields": ["_id", "name"],
      "lookupValue": "_id",
      "lookupQueries": [...]
    }
  }
  ...
}
```

#### Lookup options

Here is the full list of lookup options.

| `lookupOptions` properties | description                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `lookupFields`             | fields to be retrieved on the destination collection                                                                                                                                            |
| `lookupDelimiter`          | string with a delimiter to join values when multiple `lookupFields` are specified                                                                                                               |
| `lookupQueries`            | an array of [filters] on lookup data + `propertyType` specifying the type of the filtered property                                                                                              |
| `lookupAddTrailingSlash`   | whether or not to add a trailing `/` to `lookupDataSource` to generate the url for querying data (`true` if not specified)                                                                      |
| `lookupDeps`               | array of [dependencies](#dependent-lookups), used to specify dependencies from other fields of the form                                                                                         |

:::caution

`multilookup` must be of type `array` whereas `lookup` of type `string`

:::

##### Lookup queries

```json
{
  ...
  "ingredients": {
    "type": "array",
    "format": "multilookup",
    ...
    "lookupOptions": {
      "lookupDataSource": "ingredients",
      "lookupFields": ["_id", "name"],
      "lookupValue": "_id",
      "lookupQueries": [
        {
          "property": "allergenes",
          "operator": "hasLengthLessEqual",
          "value": 2,
          "propertyType": "array"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ...
}
```

`lookupQueries` allows to specify an array of filters that are applied to the queries for lookup data. Each element of `lookupQueries` is composed as a [filter][filters] plus the key `propertyType`, specifying the type of the property that is being filtered (defaults to "string").

| `lookupQueries` properties | description                                                     |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `property`                 | the unique identifier of the property they filter               |
| `operator`                 | the operator used to filter                                     |
| `value`                    | the value or the regex pattern (where it applies) to filter for |
| `propertyType`             | the type `property` ("string", "array", ...)                    |

##### Dependent lookups

It is furthermore possible to have the available options of a lookup/multilookup field dependending on other fields in the form.

```json
{
  ...
  "minPopulation": {
    "type": "number",
    ...
  },
  "provId": {
    "type": "string",
    "format": "lookup",
    ...
    "lookupOptions": {
      "lookupDataSource": "provinces",
      "lookupFields": ["name"],
      "lookupValue": "_id",
      "lookupDeps": [
        {
          "dependency": "minPopulation",
          "template": "{\"population\": {\"$gt\": {{current.minPopulation}}}}"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "cityIds": {
    "type": "array",
    "format": "multilookup",
    ...
    "lookupOptions": {
      "lookupDataSource": "cities",
      "lookupFields": ["name"],
      "lookupValue": "_id",
      "lookupDeps": [
        {
          "dependency": "provId",
          "currentCollectionProperty": "provinceId"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ...
}
```

The options of dependent lookup/multilookup fields are fetched with a query parametric to other fields in the form. To set out such query, `lookupDeps` should include at least one object with a `dependency` key, specifying which field, upon update, triggers the query, as well as either a template of the query itself - in `template`, or a field of the lookup collection in `currentCollectionProperty`. If the latter, a default template will be automatically created, corresponding to a query filtering entries so that `currentCollectionProperty` is equal or included in the value of the `dependency` field.

For instance,

```json
{
  "dependency": "provId",
  "currentCollectionProperty": "provinceId"
}
```

is equivalent to:

```json
{
  "dependency": "provId",
  "template": "{\"{{currentCollectionProperty}}\": {\"$in\": {{current.provId}}}}"
}
```

in case `provId` is an `array` field, or

```json
{
  "dependency": "provId",
  "template": "{\"{{currentCollectionProperty}}\": {\"$in\": [{{current.provId}}]}}"
}
```

otherwise.

:::caution
In `template`, it is necessary to use the key-word `current` before the name of the referenced field, as in: `current.fieldName`.
:::

:::caution
It is not possible to have a field be dependent on a Form Addon.
:::

:::info
In case both `currentCollectionProperty` and `template` are specified, `currentCollectionProperty` is ignored.
:::

:::info
If multiple dependencies are specified for the same lookup field, these are considered to be in a OR-clause when filtering the selectable values.
:::

In the example above, both lookups `provId` and and `cityIds` are dependent from other fields in the form. Namely:

- `provId` has a dependency towards the property `minPopulation`. The options for `provId` are all filtered by the query specified in the `template` property: all listed provinces will have a greater population than the one specified in `minPopulation`.

- `cityIds` depends on the field `provId`. In particular, only cities with the field `provinceId` equal to the value of the field `provId` from the form will be available.

Updating a field specified in the `dependency` option of a lookup/multilookup triggers:

1) queries are performed as specified in `lookupDeps` to fetch new options
2) current values of dependent fields that are not compatible with the new state of the form according to their `lookupDeps` are removed
3) options of dependent fields are updated
4) if step 2 caused the value to change, these operations are propagated to all fields that depend on the updated lookup/multilookup. In the example above, if updating `minPopulation` causes `provId`'s value to change, these 4 steps will also be performed for `cityId`.

:::info
The prop `allowAutoDisableDeps` in the [Form Drawer][bk-form-drawer] and the [Form Modal][bk-form-modal] allows to control whether or not a dependent lookup/multilookup with no options should be automatically disabled. The field is automatically re-enabled as soon as updating a controlling field causes options to be availbale.
:::

:::info
The prop `allowLiveSearchCache` in the [Crud Lookup Client][bk-crud-lookup-client] allows to cache queries performed for fetching new options.
:::

:::info
If a controlling field is on focus, new options for dependent fields are not fetched until the corresponding on-blur event happens. This is particularly useful in case of cyclic dependencies with multilookup fields, as it prevents available options to be removed while the user is still operating on the field.
:::

| `LookupDeps` properties     | description                                                                                   |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dependency`                | property name of the controlling field from the form                                          |
| `currentCollectionProperty` | item from the lookup destination collection to utilize when retrieving the selectable options |
| `template`                  | query to utilize when retrieving the selectable options                                       |

##### Multilookup styling

Due to the length of its content, a multilookup cell is often shown as a placeholder. However, if internal content is meant to be shown in-place,
it is possible to `join` its values array and print it as a string.

Single values are `.toString()`-ed while a join delimiter must be specified. In your `dataSchema`, add to the multilookup column the props:

```json
{
  "visualizationOptions": {
    ...
    "joinDelimiter": "<delimiter>"
  }
}
```

where `<delimiter>` is the string to use for join. An empty string is allowed.

### Form Links

Altogether with `type` and `properties`, at the highest level of the data schema, there is an extra key that allow listing
external references or href.

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": { ... },
  "required": [ ... ],
  "formLinks": [
    {
      "href": "/hrefPage",
      "formOptions": {
        "hiddenOnUpdate": true
      }
    },
    {
      "href": "https://www.google.com",
      "target": "_blank",
      "label": {
        "it": "Cerca su Google",
        "en": "Search on Google"
      },
      "icon": "fas fa-link",
      "query": {
        "user": "{{name}}-{{surname}}"
      },
      "formOptions": {
        "hiddenOnInsert": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The `formLinks` key takes an array of objects that represents a [Link][link]. The handlebar parser would interpret properties as data schema properties. Referring to the example above, either `name` or `surname` are `properties` of the schema or the parser interprets them as empty strings.

Instructions can be specified as `formOptions` on to whether showing such links into forms components via the `hidden` key. The form components, like [Dynamic Form Modal][bk-dynamic-form-modal] has also different opening-states, namely *insert* and *update*, hence specific hidden properties `hiddenOnInsert` and `hiddenOnUpdate` can be specified to properly tune link visualization when Back-Kit default form is used.

### Excluding properties from free search

Properties in data schema can be excluded from regex queries generated by free-text search setting the first-level property `excludeFromSearch` to `true`.

Note that some properties are automatically excluded, namely:

- `_id`, `updatedAt`, `createdAt`, and `__STATE__` CRUD properties
- properties of type `form-addon`
- properties of format `date`, `time`, `date-time`, `lookup`, `multilookup`, `file`

## Plugin Configuration

Once the data schema is set and the components to use are chosen, a full plugin can be written. Such configuration contains two parts

1. `$ref`: referenced objects. To avoid repeating the same prop, like `dataSchema`, on multiple elements.
2. `content`: the intended web page content in terms of HTML tags, either standard HTML5 or custom web components

A minimal configuration that undergoes bootstrap procedure can be achieved, being `/v2/customers` the endpoint of a valid [Mia-Platform CRUD Service][mia-platform-crud-service], with the following configuration:

```json
{
  "$ref": {
    "dataSchema": { 
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "_id": {
          "type": "string"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "content": {
    "tag": "crud-client",
    "config": {
      "basePath": "/v2/customers",
      "schema": {
        "$ref": "dataSchema"
      },
    }
  }
}
```

After a standard bootstrap time, the page will send a `GET` requests for `_id`'s on the `customers` collection, a `GET` requests for dataset count, and will emit a [display-data] event. This ends the page bootstrap.


## Styling

In addiction to the color theme, it is possible to customize the following colors:
- `--back-kit-box-shadow-color` : box shadow color of form fields such as input or select fields
- `--back-kit-danger-color` : danger/error main color
- `--back-kit-danger-color-hover` : danger/error hover color,
- `--back-kit-danger-color-box-shadow` : box shadow color of form fields such as input or select fields, when they are in danger/error mode

They are configurable in the css :root pseudo class
