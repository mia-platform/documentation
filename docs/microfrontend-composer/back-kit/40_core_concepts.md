## Localization and i18n

Back-kit web components supports localization and internationalization. Component properties that in turn expose any kind of typography can be easily internationalized by passing a `LocalizedText` object containing specific translations according to [ISO 639-1 codes].

```json
{
  "en": "house",
  "fr": "maison",
  "de": "haus",
  "it": "casa",
  "zh": "房子",
  "ar": "منزل",
  ...
}
```

Fields that support i18n are marked through this guide as taking either `LocalizedText` as input type.

Components allow to customize their copies through property `customLocale`, with support to internationalized strings.

For instance:
```json
{
  "tag": "bk-table",
  "properties": {
    "customLocale": {
      "actionsTitle": {
        "en": "Actions",
        "it": ""
      }
    }
  }
}
```

:::info
The example shows how to customize the title of the actions column of a [Table][bk-table].
The list of available copies is availbale in the [dedicated section][bk-table-locale] of each component documentation.
:::

Not all copies need to be specified. Missing copies are set to their default value, if availbale, or else fallback to the english translation.


## Dynamic configuration

Many components allow the user to build *dynamic configurations*. Such configurations are really helpful when an event needs to be aware of situation-specific data, such as, while clicking a button onto a given table row, the event must be intertwined with data of that row.

To achieve dynamic configurations logic, Back-Kit components use [handlebars syntax][handlebars-syntax] and embed a web component property to register a handlebar template. By default, a string is parsed by the handlebar parser without making any changes to it if no `{{}}`-syntax is present.

For instance, any Back-Kit component is aware of an authenticated user, if any, using the property `currentUser`. When `currentUser` has property `email` with value `my-mail@mail.com`, a configuration such

```json
{
  "user": "{{curentUser.email}}"
}
```

would be equivalent to
```json
{
  "user": "my-mail@mail.com"
}
```

### Helpers

Custom helpers to be used in conjunction with [handlebars][handlebars-syntax] are provided, most components that allow dynamic configurations support them.

#### rawObject

By default, the handlebars interpolation cast everything to string. `rawObject` allows to avoid to stringify dynamic values within a configuration.

```json
{
  "url": "/url",
  "method": "POST",
  "body": "{{rawObject data}}"
}
```

`rawObject` signals that the provided dynamic value (`data` in this case) should not be stringified. So, with input data:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "name": "Joe",
    "surname": "Smith"
  }
}
```

the example is equivalent to:

```json
{
  "url": "/url",
  "method": "POST",
  "body": {
    "name": "Joe",
    "surname": "Smith"
  }
}
```

#### rawObjectOrEmptyStr

`rawObjectOrEmptyStr` is equivalent to `rawObject` but, if the input value is not defined, an empty string will be put in place of the dynamic configuration.

#### nFormat

`nFormat` allows to format numeric values specifying number of decimal places, decimal separator, group separator.

For instance, given the dynamic configuration:

```json
{
  "amount1": "$ {{nFormat '2.,' value}}",
  "amount2": "$ {{nFormat '4.,' value}}",
  "amount3": "$ {{nFormat '.,' value}}",
  "amount4": "$ {{nFormat '.' value}}",
  "amount5": "$ {{nFormat '' value}}"
}
```

and input data:

```json
{
  "value": 7654.321
}
```

the resulting configuration is:

```json
{
  "amount1": "7,654.32",
  "amount2": "7,654.3210",
  "amount3": "7,654.321",
  "amount4": "7654.321",
  "amount5": "7654.321"
}
```

#### $dateNow

`$dateNow` allows to get the current date and time in ISO format.

For instance, given the dynamic configuration:

```json
{
  "dateTime": "{{ $dateNow }}",
}
```

the resulting configuration is:

```json
{
  "dateTime": "2024-10-15T12:37:41.302Z",
}
```

### Template - ConfigMap

Some components allow to specify an object with fields `template`-`configMap` instead of a value for their dynamically configurable properties.

```json
{
  "command": {
    "template": "{{color}}",
    "configMap": {
      "red": "stop",
      "yellow": "slow-down",
      "$default": "go"
    }
  }
}
```

The value of `template` is matched against keys of `configMap`. On the first match, the corresponding value in `configMap` is used as value for the dynamic variable.

For instance, with context
```json
{
  "color": "red"
}
```
the above example is equivalent to:
```json
{
  "command": "stop"
}
```

`$default` key in `configMap` can be specified, and is used if no other `configMap` key matches `template`.

### Extracting data from URL - UrlMask

Some components may expose properties that allow to configure a `urlMask`. This leverages [path-to-regexp] syntax to convert a string input (or `mask`) into a regular expression to be matched against the current URL, allowing to extract information from it, making it availbale in dynamic configurations.

`urlMask`s allow to specify masks for the `pathname` and `search` fields of `window.location`.

```typescript
type UrlMask = string | {
  pathname?: string,
  search?: string
}
```

If `urlMask` is a string, it is matched against both pathname and search fields.

#### Example

A `urlMask` such as
```json
{
  "urlMask": {
    "pathname": "/path-name/:field1/:field2",
    "search": "\\?pageSize=:pSize&sortDirection=:sDirection"
  }
}
```

matched againsta a `window.location` like
```json
{
  "pathname": "/path-name/field-1/field-2",
  "search": "?pageSize=25&sortDirection=descend"
}
```

will produce as output
```json
{
  "path": "/path-name/field-1/field-2",
  "params": {
    "field1": "field-1",
    "field2": "field-2"
  }
}
```
from `pathname` and
```json
{
  "path": "?pageSize=25&sortDirection=descend",
  "params": {
    "pSize": "25",
    "sDirection": "descend"
  }
}
```
from `search`.

Some components may allow to ignore part of the URL using wildcards, "(.*)". For instance:
```json
{
  "urlMask": "\\?pageNumber=:myPageNumber&pageNumber=(.*)"
}
```

## Links

A standard interface is available for encoding external links and href. This interface can be found as building block of several Back-Kit web components properties.

A basic external href link rendering in a browser new tab can be implemented as

```json
{
  "href": "https://www.mia-platform.eu/",
  "target": "_blank",
  "icon": "fas fa-link"
}
```

Property `href` can either be absolute or relative, `target` can be picked amongst `_blank`, `_self`, `_parent`, `_top`: most commonly either an href renders into the same window with `_self` or it opens a new tab with `_blank`.

The `icon` properties allow to attach a [Fontawesome fas or far icon][fontawesome] when the link is rendered by a component which support this interface.

A web component that contains state or data might implement [dynamic configurations](#dynamic-configuration). In this case the `href` can be enriched with query parameters that are bound to the internal state of the component with which the user is interacting. Suppose the user with email `my-mail@mail.com` is in session, then the following link

```json
{
  "href": "customers",
  "query": {
    "name": "John",
    "createdBy": "admin|{{currentUser.email}}"
  }
}
```

renders the dynamic link `./ingredients?name=John&createdBy=admin%7Cmy-mail%40mail.com`.


## Filters

Back-kit web components refine data queries and data views using filters. Filters can be used to enrich a [change-query] and are building blocks of many tag properties. A filter is made of three
required build blocks:

1. `property`: the unique identifier of the property they filter
2. `operator`: the [operator](#filter-operators) used to filter
3. `value`: the value or the regex pattern (where it applies) to filter for

Operators and values vary according to the property type which is set by the [data schema][data-schema]. If a `DataSchema` should be filtered only according with a subset of available operators, a configuration key it available within the field `filtersOptions`. The key `availableOperators` is an array of string which, if defined, enables only explicitly selected operators on the given field.

### Filter Operators

Filter operators can be selected from the following list:

```typescript
type FilterOperator = |
  'equal' |
  'exists' |
  'notEqual' |
  'greater' |
  'greaterEqual' |
  'less' |
  'lessEqual' |
  'regex' |
  'includeSome' |
  'includeAll' |
  'includeExactly' |
  'notIncludeAny' |
  'between' |
  'notBetween' |
  'hasLengthEqual' |
  'hasLengthGreaterEqual' |
  'hasLengthLessEqual'
```

## Inline queries

Some components allow to filter data based on inline queries - that is, queries that are directly applied to the data in the state of the component, no call to the backend is performed.

The supported syntax for inline queries is [mongo-like], and their implementation is based on the [SiftJS] library.

Supported operators are:
  - [$in]
  - [$nin]
  - [$exists]
  - [$gte]
  - [$gt]
  - [$lte]
  - [$lt]
  - [$eq]
  - [$ne]
  - [$mod]
  - [$all]
  - [$and]
  - [$or]
  - [$nor]
  - [$not]
  - [$size]
  - [$type]
  - [$regex]
  - [$elemMatch]

Most components allow queries to include [dynamic values](#dynamic-configuration). If that is the case, it is the components responsibility to ensure that sufficient context is provided to resolve the query.

For instance, the following query
```json
{
  "$or": [
    {"$name": "{{searchedName}}"},
    {"age": {"$gte": 25}}
  ]
}
```

provided with context:
```json
{
  "searchedName": "Foo"
}
```

is equivalent to:
```json
{
  "$or": [
    {"$name": "Foo"},
    {"age": {"$gte": 25}}
  ]
}
```

Just like a regular mongo query, applying such it to data:
```json
[
  {"name": "Foo", "age": 15},
  {"name": "Bar", "age": 27},
  {"name": "Que", "age": 18},
  {"name": "Asd", "age": 10}
]
```

matches:
```json
[
  {"name": "Foo", "age": 15},
  {"name": "Bar", "age": 27}
]
```
