The Expandable Filters consist in a form which allows to apply [filters] to a collection.
Each field of the form is associated to a field of the collection and to a [filter operator][filter-operators].
Upon submitting the form:
  - inserted values for each field are used to create an array of filters with the corresponding associated
  collection field and filter operator.
  No filter is applied for fields without values.
  - The need to filter the data according to such filters is signaled to other components.
  This is achieved by emitting a [change-query] event.
  Components such as the [CRUD Client][bk-crud-client] might pick up on this request.
  Note that, differently from the [Filter Drawer][bk-filter-drawer],
  the Expandable Filters are not designed to interact with the [Filters Manager][bk-filters-manager].

The form is hidden/spawned whenever the request to provide support for applying filters is signaled.
That is, whenever a [filter] event is received.

The fields within the form are organized into a grid with a maximum number of columns of 4, which shrinks to 3 or 2 depending on the window width.

<!-- TODO ?
:::caution
`bk-expanded-filters` should not be included in the same configuration as [`bk-filter-drawer`](#bk-filter-drawer)/[`bk-filters-manager`](#bk-filters-manager) since they listen and emit the same events and clashing behavior might occur.
::: -->

## How to configure

Properties `dataSchema` and `filtersConfig` should be specified in the Expandable Filters configuration.

```json
{
  "tag": "bk-expanded-filters",
  "properties": {
    "dataSchema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "dishes": {"type": "array", "format": "multilookup"},
        "name": {"type": "string"},
        "orderedAt": {"type": "string", "format": "date-time"},
      }
    },
    "filtersConfig": [
      {
        "property": "orderedAt",
        "operator": "between"
      },
      "dishes",
      "name"
    ]
  }
}
```

The [data-schema] describes the structure of the underlying data, while `filtersConfig` specifies the fields to show and their associated collection property and [filter operator][filter-operators].
`filtersConfig` is an array of strings and/or objects with keys "property" and "operator".
String entries are interpreted as the collection property to associate to the field, and a default operator is used.
The default operator is always `equal` unless the property is of format `multilookup`, in which case `includesAll` is used.
It is not possible to specify the same property more than once.

Properties with `filterOptions.hidden` set to true in the data-schema are not shown.

:::caution
Filters on properties of type array or object are not available, unless they have format `lookup` of `multilookup` (only for array field).
:::


### Bootstrap - Apply filters from URL

If property `readFromUrl` is set to true, the Expandable Filters parse the page URL to retrieve the query parameter `filters`.
If found, its content is converted to filters that are used to initialize the form values and are applied accordingly to [filtersConfig](#how-to-configure).

### Lookup fields (writable views)

Fields described inside the data-schema as having type `object` or `array` and format `lookup` are rendered respectively as select and multi-select fields.

Options for such fields will be dynamically fetched from the endpoint specified in `basePath` property, using the `/lookup` route provided by the [CRUD Service][crud-service] to [writable views][writable-views] (version 6.9.0 or higher) , which returns a list of objects.
Each option fetched like this should have at least a `label` field, which is used as display value inside the form, and a `value` field which is used as unique identifier for such option.

### Locale

The texts of the Expandable Filters can be customized through the property `customLocale`, which accepts an object shaped like the following:

```typescript
type Locale = {
  buttons: {
    applyButton: LocalizedText
    clearButton: LocalizedText
  },
  valueInputPlaceholder: LocalizedText
  valueSelectPlaceholder: LocalizedText
  true: LocalizedText
  false: LocalizedText
  datePicker: {
    lang: {
      locale: LocalizedText,
      placeholder: LocalizedText
      rangePlaceholder: {
        start: LocalizedText
        stop: LocalizedText
      },
      today: LocalizedText
      now: LocalizedText
      backToToday: LocalizedText
      ok: LocalizedText
      clear: LocalizedText
      month: LocalizedText
      year: LocalizedText
      timeSelect: LocalizedText
      dateSelect: LocalizedText
      monthSelect: LocalizedText
      yearSelect: LocalizedText
      decadeSelect: LocalizedText
      monthBeforeYear: 'true' | 'false'
      previousMonth: LocalizedText
      nextMonth: LocalizedText
      previousYear: LocalizedText
      nextYear: LocalizedText
      previousDecade: LocalizedText
      nextDecade: LocalizedText
      previousCentury: LocalizedText
      nextCentury: LocalizedText
    },
    timePickerLocale:{
      placeholder: LocalizedText
    }
  }
}
```

where [LocalizedText][localized-text] is either a string or an object mapping language acronyms to strings.


## Examples

### Example: Basic Usage

Given the following configuration,
```json
{
  "tag": "bk-expanded-filters",
  "properties": {
    "dataSchema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "dishes": {"type": "array", "format": "multilookup"},
        "name": {"type": "string"},
        "orderedAt": {"type": "string", "format": "date-time"},
      }
    },
    "filtersConfig": [
      {
        "property": "orderedAt",
        "operator": "between"
      },
      "dishes",
      "name"
    ]
  }
}
```

it is possible to specify a value for filtering properties `dishes`, `name` and `orderedAt`.
Assuming the inserted values to be representable as:

```json
{
  "orderedAt": ["2023-03-03T09:00:00.000Z", "2023-03-03T12:00:00.000Z"],
  "name": "Joe",
  "dishes": ["dish-1", "dish-2"]
}
```

Then the emitted filters look like:

```json
{
  "property": "orderedAt",
  "operator": "between",
  "value": ["2023-03-03T09:00:00.000Z", "2023-03-03T12:00:00.000Z"]
},
{
  "property": "name",
  "operator": "equal",
  "value": "Joe"
},
{
  "property": "dishes",
  "operator": "includesAll",
  "value": ["dish-1", "dish-2"]
}
```

If a component such as the [CRUD Client][bk-crud-client] is included in the page (and provided with the same data-schema), these filters are chained inside an `$and` mongo-like query and used to retrieved filtered data.


### Example: Apply filters from URL

Assuming the Expandable Filters to be configured like:

```json
{
  "tag": "bk-expanded-filters",
  "properties": {
    "dataSchema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "name": {"type": "string"},
        "price": {"type": "number"},
        "orderedAt": {"type": "string", "format": "date-time"}
      }
    },
    "filtersConfig": [
      "name",
      {"property": "price", "operator": "less"},
      {"property": "orderedAt", "operator": "between"}
    ]
  }
}
```

and the following query parameter to be included in the URL of the current plugin:

```json
{
  "filters": [
    {"property": "name", "operator": "equal", "value": "test"},
    {"property": "price", "operator": "less", "value": 10},
    {"property": "orderedAt", "operator": "less", "value": "2023-03-03T09:00:00.000Z"}
  ]
}
```

then a [change-query] event will be emitted with filters:

```json
{
  "property": "name",
  "operator": "equal",
  "value": "test"
},
{
  "property": "price",
  "operator": "less",
  "value": 10
}
```

Filter on field "orderedAt" is not emitted since the filter operator `less` does not correspond to the one specified for the property inside `filtersConfig` (`between`).
