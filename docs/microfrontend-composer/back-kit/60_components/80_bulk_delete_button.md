```

This component renders a button that allows to request deletion of multiple items at the same time in a bulk operation.

## How to configure

The Bulk Delete Button does not require any configuration.

```json
{
  "tag": "bk-bulk-delete"
}
```

<!-- TODO remove commented paragraph and link deletion flow -->
<!-- ### CRUD Service deletion
As per [CRUD-Service][crud-service] specifications, deletion consists in editing the `__STATE__` field of the items. In particular, following the CRUD-service [__STATE__ pattern][state-pattern], the process of deletion involves editing items from the "PUBLIC" or "DRAFT" `__STATE__` to the "TRASH" state, and moving items from the "TRASH" `__STATE__` to the "DELETED" state. -->

### How it works

1. The component begins in a disabled state, rendering it unresponsive to user interactions
2. When components such as the [Table][bk-table] or the [Gallery][bk-gallery] notify that items have been selected, the Bulk Delete Button becomes active. The Bulk Delete Button keeps as state an internal representation of the selected items.
3. Upon clicking, the component requests a confirmation dialog box to be spawned
4. Upon confirmation, a notification for the requests of bulk deletion of selected items is emitted

Note that the Bulk Delete Button always asks for confirmation before issuing a request for data deletion. Therefore, a component such as the [Confirmation Modal][bk-confirmation-modal] should be included in the plugin.

<!-- TODO add link to confirmation flow -->
