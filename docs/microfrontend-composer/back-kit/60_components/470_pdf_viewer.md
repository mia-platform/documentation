allows to visualize PDF files in the browser through an `iframe` which embeds the default browser PDF viewer.
While the Pdf Viewer is capable of previewing various file types, it is recommended to restrict its use primarily to the visualization of PDF files.

Upon listening to the [show-in-viewer] event, the Pdf Viewer retrieves the URL of the file to preview from the event payload and shows it.

## How to configure
