The Pagination displays pagination navigation tools to query pages of a dataset.
It allows moving backward and forward between pages, skipping to the first and last pages, and adjusting the current pagination size.
Additionally, it displays a counter showing the current page and the total number of pages.
It shows the current page and total elements in a given dataset while interacting with dynamic filters.

The Pagination communicates with other components by providing pagination parameters for data retrieval.
It achieves this by injecting keys `pageNumber` and `pageSize` into the payload of a [change-query] event, which is emitted upon interacting with the component.
Components such as the [CRUD Client][bk-crud-client] can listen to this event and use the provided pagination parameters to fetch new data accordingly.

Furthermore, the Pagination component listens to [count-data] events, which relay information about the size of the currently viewed dataset, to update its state.

In cases where the signaled **data count is negative**, the Pagination adjusts its view. In this scenario, only tasks such as navigating between pages and modifying the pagination size can be performed.
Additionally, no information is provided about the currently viewed page or the total number of pages.

In case the request to visualize or navigate [nested data][nested-data-flow] is received, the Pagination notifies other components on what slice of data should be visualized according to its state.

## How to configure

For its most basic usage, the Pagination does not require any particular configuration.

```json
{
  "tag": "bk-pagination"
}
```

Properties `pageSize` and `pageSizeOptions` are available to configure the default value and the selectable options for pagination size.

| `pageSize`        | `page-size` | number   | 25                | number of data items per page |
| `pageSizeOptions` | -           | number[] | [10, 25, 50, 100] | available page sizes          |

### Listens to

| [nested-navigation-state/push] | updates internal representation of the current nesting path by adding one step. Emits [nested-navigation-state/display] with slice of data to display |
| [nested-navigation-state/back] | updates internal representation of the current nesting path by removing the specified number of steps. Emits [nested-navigation-state/display] with slice of data to display |

### Emits

| event                             | description                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [change-query]                    | requires data filtered according with the current pagination  |
| [nested-navigation-state/display] | in case of nested data, notifies the slice of data to display |
