```html

```

The Import Modal renders a modal to allow the user to signal the need for a data import to be performed on a collection.

## How to configure

The Import Modal does not require any particular configuration.

```json
{
  "tag": "bk-import-modal"
}
```

The body of the rendered modal is a form that allows the user to select what parameters should be appended to the import data request. These include:
  - the file with the data to be imported
  - what encoding should be used ("utf8",  "ucs2", ...) to parse the file, in case this is of type CSV
  - what delimiter should be used (comma or semicolon) to parse the file, in case this is of type CSV
  - what escape character should be used to parse the file, in case this is of type CSV

Supported file extensions are: `.ndjson`, `.json`, `.csv`


Upon submitting the Import Modal, this signals the need to import data with the specified options.
A component like the [CRUD Client][bk-crud-client] could pick up on this request and trigger data import (as long as backend services includes an instance of the [CRUD Service][crud-service] of version 6.9.0 or higher).
