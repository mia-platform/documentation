In order to configure the service, a set of environment variables are adopted for
describing basic service needs, alongside a main configuration file and a sandbox
processor function.

## Environment Variables

| Variable                    | Description                                                                                                                | Default                       |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| LOG_LEVEL                   | the maximum log level to emit. Accepted levels are  `trace`\|`debug`\|`info`\|`warn`\|`error`                              | `info`                        |
| HTTP_PORT                   | the HTTP port on which kubernetes status routes and metrics are exposed                                                    | `3000`                        |
| CONFIGURATION_FOLDER        | the filepath to the folder under which configuration file and sandbox processor user-defined function are located          | `<HOME>/.df/stream-processor` |
| OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT | specify the OpenTelemetry OTLP endpoint where traces and metrics should be pushed. When not set, telemetry is not exported |                               |

:::info

Currently `<HOME>` value is set to `/home/stream_processor`, which is based on how the service image is built.

:::

## Configuration Files

To configure _Stream Processor service_, a main configuration file `config.json`
and the processor function should be placed within the folder pointed by the
`CONFIGURATION_FOLDER` environment variable. It is expected to find the `config.json`
at the root of the config folder, while the processor function nested under the
`processors` folder.
Since only `javascript` is currently supported, all processing function will be
written in a `index.js` nested under `javascript` folder.

:::info

Folders under `processors` directory should be named as the language employed to
write the processor function.

:::


Here it is shown the layout the configuration folder should have:

```shell
├── config.json         # --> the configuration file
└── processors
    └── javascript
        └── index.js    # --> user-defined processing function
```

### Service Settings file

The main configuration file describes the connection details with the stream
platform, which customizations should be applied to the consumer and producer,
whether one or more cache connections should be instantiated and how the sandbox
should behave.

The file respects the following JSON schema and the following paragraph it is
exampled in details.

<SchemaViewer schema={SPSchema} example={SPConfigSchema} />

:::note

The raw JSON schema can also be found <a target="_blank" href="/schemas/fast_data/stream-processor.0.5.2.schema.json">here</a>.

In addition, Kafka configurations and cache persistence properties
support [**secret resolution**](/products/fast_data/fast_data_engine_v2/secrets_resolution.md).

:::

#### Required Fields

The configuration requires three mandatory fields:

- **`consumer`**: defines how the service consumes messages from the data source
- **`producer`**: defines how the service produces messages to the output destination  
- **`processor`**: defines the processing engine and its settings

#### Consumer Configuration

The `consumer` field configures the input stream source. Currently supports:

- **Kafka Consumer** (`type: "kafka"`): configures connection to a Kafka topic for message consumption
  - `config`: [`librdkafka`](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/clients/librdkafka/html/md_CONFIGURATION.html)
    consumer configuration properties (connection strings, authentication, etc.)
  - `topic`: name of the Kafka topic to read messages from
  - `commitIntervalMs`: interval between offset commits (default: 500ms)

#### Producer Configuration

The `producer` field configures the output stream destination. Currently supports:

- **Kafka Producer** (`type: "kafka"`): configures connection to a Kafka topic for message production
  - `config`: [`librdkafka`](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/clients/librdkafka/html/md_CONFIGURATION.html)
    producer configuration properties (connection strings, authentication, etc.)
  - `topic`: name of the Kafka topic to write processed messages to

#### Processor Configuration

The `processor` field configures the processing engine. Currently supports:

- **JavaScript Sandbox** (`type: "javascript"`): Configures the JavaScript execution environment
  - `interruptMs`: maximum execution time per function call (default: `5000ms`)
  - `consoleBuffer`: console buffer size in bytes (default: `1024`)
  - `maxStackSize`: maximum stack size in bytes (optional, uses QuickJS default)
  - `maxHeapSize`: maximum heap size in bytes (optional, uses QuickJS default)
  - `payloadSerdeStrategy`: serialization/deserialization strategy for message payloads
    For more details, please read the [corresponding section](/products/fast_data/fast_data_engine_v2/stream_processor/30_Usage.md#input-payload-deserialization) in Usage page.

#### Caches Configuration (Optional)

The `caches` field is an optional object that defines named caches for use within
processing functions. In case no cache is defined, the _Stateful Stream Processing_
use case cannot be supported.

Each cache can be:

- **MongoDB Cache** (`type: "mongodb"`): Persistent cache backed by MongoDB
  - `url`: MongoDB connection string (supports secrets)
  - `collection`: collection name for cache storage
  - `database`: database name (optional)
  - `appName`: application name for MongoDB connection (optional - useful to track
    which program is carrying out queries on the database)
- **In-Memory Cache** (`type: "in-memory"`): Simple in-memory key-value storage.
  Use only when sharing the stream state across different service
  instances is not necessary. However, when it is possible use a sharable stream state.

For more details on how to interact with the caches, please read the
[dedicated section](/products/fast_data/fast_data_engine_v2/stream_processor/30_Usage.md#cache-access-) in the Usage page.

#### Control Plane Configuration (Optional)

The `controlPlane` field is optional and configures integration with the Control Plane Operator:

- `grpcAddress`: gRPC server address for service feedback events
- `feedbackInterval`: interval between feedback events in milliseconds (default: `3000ms`)
- `resumeAfterMs`: delay before processing when control plane connection fails (optional)

#### Secret Management

The schema supports flexible secret management through the `Secret` type, which can be:

- **Direct value**: plain string value
- **Environment variable** (`type: "env"`): read from environment variable
  - `key`: environment variable name
  - `encoding`: Optional encoding (e.g., "base64")
- **File reference** (`type: "file"`): read from file system
  - `path`: file path containing the secret
  - `key`: optional key to read a single value among other properties (for `.ini` or
    `.json` files). When not provided, the whole file content is loaded as the secret value
  - `encoding`: optional encoding (e.g., "base64")

For more details, please refer to [secrets resolution](/products/fast_data/fast_data_engine_v2/secrets_resolution.md)
in config maps documentation page and [`secret_rs`](https://docs.rs/secret_rs/latest/secret_rs/index.html)
library documentation.

### Sandbox User-Defined Function file

Once the sandbox settings are defined, it is possible to write your custom function
in the `index.js` file.

For more details on how the user-defined processor function can be written
and it how works, please read the [Usage](/products/fast_data/fast_data_engine_v2/stream_processor/30_Usage.md) page.

## Control Plane Support

The service implements the interface for connecting towards a Control-Plane Operator.  
However, complete [Runtime Management](/products/fast_data/runtime_management/overview.mdx) support, that is with Control Plane UI
and a central Control Plane instance will be added in the future.

## Recommended Kafka Configuration

When configuring Kafka consumer, it is advised to set appropriate values for
constraining the consumer internal queue. In this manner:

- the maximum amount of memory employed by the service can be finely tuned to avoid
  wasting resources, since only the number of messages that can effectively be
  processed in real-time should be pulled in memory;
- it is ensured that consumer continuously poll the broker to avoid it exiting the
  consumer group, since a lower number of buffered messages can trigger a new fetch to
  replenish it;

The main values to tune are:

- `queued.max.messages.kbytes`: maximum number of kilobytes of queued pre-fetched
  messages in the local consumer queue;
- `queued.min.messages`: minimum number of messages per topic+partition _librdkafka_
  tries to maintain in the local consumer queue;

It is recommended to set `queued.min.messages` to a value greater, but close to the
average message consumption rate. It is possible to observer:

- `kafka_consumer_rx_msgs_total` &rarr; messages read
- `sp_processed_messages` &rarr; total number of processed messages

to check the average values.

For _Stream Processor_ service, an example of configuration can be the following one:

```json
{
  "queued.max.messages.kbytes": "32840",
  "queued.min.messages": "5000"
}
```

Another important property that might need to be tuned is `fetch.message.max.bytes`,
which however should be changed only in case `queued.max.messages.kbytes` is set to
a value lower than `1024`.

## Kubernetes

### Resources

When the plugin is deployed on Kubernetes, it is advised to set its resources
_requests_ and _limits_. Here are provided which are the recommended and minimum
ones, although they can be changed according to your needs:

#### Recommended

- request:
  ```text
  CPU: 100m 
  Memory: 20MB
  ```
- limits:
  ```text
  CPU: 800m/1000m
  Memory: 100MB
  ```

#### Minimum

- request:
  ```text
  CPU: 50m 
  Memory: 15MB
  ```
- limits:
  ```text
  CPU: 250m 
  Memory: 60MB
  ```

:::note

Memory usage also depends on the parameter described in the previous section. As a result,
it is advised to adjust the requests and limits accordingly when changing consumer queue
parameters.

:::

### Status Probes

The service exposes the `liveness` and `readines` status probes as HTTP endpoint, which
helps Kubernetes when the service is successfully started and when it may need to be restarted.

The endpoints are:

- `liveness` probe: `/-/healthz`
- `readiness` probe: `/-/ready`
