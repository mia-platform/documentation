## Monitoring Infrastructure

The Monitoring section in the Console is the dedicated area to control and monitor all the resources deployed within your Project.

It is possible to change the environment to monitor, by selecting it with the dropdown in the top right of the screen.

Using this section, you can monitor your kubernetes resources by selecting the desired one from the menu on the left.  
The available Kubernetes resources are:
- [**Pods**](/products/console/monitoring/resources/pods.md):
- [**Deployments**](/products/console/monitoring/resources/deployments.md):
- [**Services**](/products/console/monitoring/resources/services.md):
- [**Cronjobs**](/products/console/monitoring/resources/cronjobs.md):
- [**Jobs**](/products/console/monitoring/resources/jobs.md):
- [**Namespaces**](/products/console/monitoring/resources/namespace.md):

From version 13.3.0, if properly configured and deployed through the Console, you will also be able to monitor the status of one or more [**Custom Resources**](/products/console/design-your-projects/custom-resources/custom-resources.md) in the _Custom Resources_ section of the sidebar.
