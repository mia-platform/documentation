## [3.5.0] 2025-09-05

### Changed

- introduce support to `null` equality in ER-Schema conditions. For example:
  ```json title='ER-Schema'
  {
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "config": {
      "A": {
        "outgoing": {
          "B": {
            "conditions": {
              "A_to_B": {
                "condition": {
                  "A_FIELD_3": null
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

### Dependencies

- updated `fast-data-automation-lib` to version `3.3.2`

## [3.4.1] 2025-04-09

### Fixed

- Topics not handled by the control plane are resumed and work independently

## [3.4.0] 2025-01-23

### Added

- `maxBatchSize` property in producer configuration to configure the number of messages that can be written in a single request
- `forceResume` setting field to `controlPlane.settings.channel` that can either be a boolean or an object with a numeric field `timeout.ms`, defining the amount of time for control plane pipelines to be resumed after an unsuccessful connection.

### Changed

### Removed

- `gRPC` Control Plane Feedback client
- `Kafka` Control Plane client

## [3.3.4] 2025-01-16

### Fixed

- Reconnect Control Plane GRPC client when Control Plane Operator restarts

## [3.3.3] 2024-12-10

### Added

## [3.3.2] 2024-07-29

### Fixed

- Non recoverable errors now make the service crash

## [3.3.1] 2024-04-29

### Added

- add support for secret variables in the event-store config map

## [3.3.0] 2024-04-23

### Updated

- **control plane** connection, which can be configured also using [gRPC protocol](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/introduction/) supported by control plane backend. 

  Two possible configurations can be set over the JSON file located at the path specified by `CONTROL_PLANE_CONFIG_PATH`:
  - `full-duplex`: the service will open a bidirectional streaming channel to send its state and receive updates
    ```json
    {
      "feedback": {
        "type": "grpc"
      },
      "state": {
        "type": "grpc"
      },
      "settings": {
        "channel": {
          // interval for which service will send its state
          // defaults to 2500ms if not specified
          "heartbet.ms": 2500 
        },
        "grpc": {
          // tells the service the hostname of your control plane istance
          "host": "your-control-plane-host",
          // port where the service is exposed, defaults to grpc default 50051
          "port": 50051 
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  - `feedback-only`: the service will open a request streaming channel to send its state, while the control plane will send updates using a kafka topic
    ```json
    {
      "feedback": {
        "type": "grpc"
      },
      "state": {
        "type": "kafka",
        "configuration": { /** kafka connection configuration */ }
      },
      "settings": { /** same as full-duplex */ }
    }
    ```
    
## [3.2.0] 2024-04-11

### Added

- **control plane feature**, where:
  - `pr-update` topics can paused/resumed over commands sent by the control plane service. 
  - the service updates periodically the control-plane about the state of its topics.
  
To enable these features, the following environment variables are needed:

  - `CONTROL_PLANE_CONFIG_PATH`: absolute path of the JSON file containing the connection details to the control plane.
  - `CONTROL_PLANE_BINDINGS_PATH`: absolute path of the JSON file containing the link between control plane artifacts and pr-update topics. This file is auto-generated by Mia Console

## [3.1.6] 2024-02-13

### Added

- introduce support for `snappy` compression both on the consumer and producer sides.
  While compression coded employed on the consumer is automatically recognized, on the producer
  it is necessary to be configured explicitly. This can be achieved by adding `compressionName` property
  to event store producer configuration, which can get one of the following values:
    - `none` (default when no value provided)
    - `snappy` (recommended)
    - `gzip`

## [3.1.5] 2024-02-09

### Updated

- `fast-data-automation-lib` to `v3.1.5`

## [3.1.4] 2023-12-15

### Fixed

- Service won't shutdown without logs when the kafka consumer cannot parse a message
- improve description of `FD_SVTG_E0003` error code

## [3.1.2] 2023-10-10

### Fixed

- review support of custom CA certificate for Kafka Producer client

## [3.1.1] 2023-10-02

### Added

- message header to `sv-trigger` events to specify which schema it is employed

### Changed

- upgraded `fast-data-automation-lib` to `v3.1.3` to fix an issue on `pr-update` events with `after` property in message payload set to `null`
- updated development demo to test service functioning with multiple projections
- updated definition of `__internal__kafkaInfo` in `pr-update` event to avoid conflicts with types

## [3.1.0] 2023-09-25

### Added

- add support for `v2.0.0` of pr-update 

### Changed

- update NodeJS version to `v18.18.0`

## [3.0.4] 2023-09-22

### Added

- Added check on foreign keys to know if running strategy on both before and after is necessary

### Changed

- upgraded `fast-data-automation-lib` to `v3.1.2`
- remove unused environment variables `READ_TOPIC_FROM_BEGINNING` and `CA_CERT_PATH`. Their actual configuration can be found within the event store config file
- update NodeJS version to `v18.17.1`
- updated library dependencies

### Fixed

- additional CA files can be added to the `ssl` config of the event store
- removed printing invalid event store configuration to avoid sharing sensitive information

## [3.0.3] 2023-07-25

### Added

- updated service dependencies

## [3.0.2] 2023-06-30

### Fixed

- Kafka log level is mapped to the kafkajs string, not number

## [3.0.1] 2023-06-27

### Fixed

- Kafka brokers is a comma separated string, not an array of strings

## [3.0.0] 2023-06-27

### Added

- Added support for the generation of MongoDB projection changes instead of `sv-trigger` kafka messages

### Breaking Changes

- kafkaProjectionChanges configMap does not support `__lookup__` strategy type anymore since `pr-updates` events for `PATCH` operations are supported also by the Single View Creator
- consequently, the service won't emit `sv-trigger` messages of type `patch`, in fact the property `type` has been removed from `sv-trigger` messages altogether 
- kafka configuration is not passed through environment variables but through its own config map [`Input Output Config`](/products/fast_data/configuration/single_view_trigger_generator.mdx#input-output-config)
- `TRIGGER_TOPIC` environment variable has been generalized and renamed to `EVENT_STORE_TARGET` to have meaning also with mongo collections 

## [2.0.1] 2023-04-14

### Changed

- review error codes to be aligned with the troubleshooting guidelines

## [2.0.0] 2023-04-13

### Breaking Changes

- environmental variables
  - renamed `STRATEGIES_FOLDER` into `MANUAL_STRATEGIES_FOLDER` 
  - renamed `CUSTOM_FUNCTIONS_FOLDER` into `TRIGGER_CUSTOM_FUNCTIONS_FOLDER`
  - removed `USE_AUTOMATIC`
  - `SINGLE_VIEW_NAME`, `ER_SCHEMA_FOLDER`, `PROJECTION_CHANGES_SCHEMA_FOLDER` are now always required
- manual and custom strategy functions are expected to be AsyncGenerator of `IdentifierObject` instead of
returning a Promise containing a list of `IdentifierObject`

### Added

- upgraded Docker image to node v18.15.0
- reviewed pipeline removing unneeded packages installation
- reduced the size of the trigger message buffer from 500 to 100 to prevent issues with JS garbage collector

### Removed
