Platform as a Service (PaaS) software is a **cloud computing model** that provides a platform for developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without the complexity of infrastructure management. Mia-Platform Console, which is the **cloud application platform**, runs top of infrastructure as a service and it offers a range of tools, services, and resources necessary for the whole product life-cycle development.
