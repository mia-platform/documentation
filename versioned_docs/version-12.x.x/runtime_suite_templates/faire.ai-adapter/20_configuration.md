### Kafka

Kafka can be enabled setting the `MODE` variable to `KAFKA`, in this case the `KAFKA_CONFIG_FILE_PATH` variable is required and REST endpoint is disabled.
The configuration has the following schema:
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "required": [
    "clientId",
    "brokers",
    "authMechanism",
    "username",
    "password",
    "consumerConfig",
    "producerConfig",
  ],
  "properties": {
    "clientId": { "type": "string"},
    "brokers": { "type": "string"},
    "authMechanism": { "type": "string"},
    "username": { "type": "string"},
    "password": { "type": "string"},
    "connectionTimeout": { "type": "number"},
    "authenticationTimeout": { "type": "number"},
    "connectionRetries": { "type": "number"},
    "consumerConfig": {
      "type": "object",
      "required": [
        "groupId",
        "topic",
      ],
      "properties": {
        "topic": { "type": "string" },
        "groupId": { "type": "string" },
        "sessionTimeout": { "type": "number" },
        "rebalanceTimeout": { "type": "number" },
        "heartbeatInterval": { "type": "number" },
        "allowAutoTopicCreation": { "type": "boolean" },
      },
    },
    "producerConfig": {
      "type": "object",
      "required": [
        "topic",
      ],
      "properties": {
        "topic": { "type": "string" },
        "allowAutoTopicCreation": { "type": "boolean" },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

## Service Logic
In order to customize the logic or integrate an external service you can modify the following files: 
- `/src/lib/service.ts`: contains custom logic
- `/src/restHandlers/service.ts` and `/src/kafkaHandlers/service.ts`: contains service handlers
- `/src/clients/externalServiceClient.ts`: contains the logic to perform calls to external service

## Process Data
Data extracted can be modified before send them to main flow manager. 
In particular, a mapping function, defined in `/src/services/mainFlowDataMapping.ts`,  is applied by default in order to map the extracted data to the main process schema.
