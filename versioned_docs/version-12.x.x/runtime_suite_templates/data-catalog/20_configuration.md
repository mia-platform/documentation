Due to licensing _Data Catalog Agent_ requires packaging with third-party software, unless your datasources are PostgreSQL databases whose support is already included in the docker image of _Data Catalog Agent_.

In case only PostgreSQL is needed you can skip to the [cronjob configuration](#cronjob-configuration) section.

## Datasource support

Mia's _Data Catalog_ marketplace item upon creation, creates also a git repository containing:

1. a CI config file
2. a docker `Dockerfile`

the `Dockerfile` provides several build steps to include the datasource support you need. Supported datasources are:

- Oracle Database from 11 to 21
- PostgreSQL from 9.6 to 16
- Mysql from 5.7 to 8.2
- Mssql from 2017 to 2022

Upon inspection you'll notice that the `Dockerfile` contains targets for each database:

```Dockerfile
FROM ... AS data-catalog-agent-oracle

# rest of the file

FROM ... AS data-catalog-agent-mysql

# and so on...
```

Each push on the default branch or any tag starting with `v` will create a new docker image including the selected support. The default support is `postgres` but it can be changed:

1. by editing the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file overriding the initial value of the `DOCKER_TARGET` from `postgres` to the database you need to support
2. one-of change upon manually triggering the CI overriding the same variable `DOCKER_TARGET`

Your repository contains a `README.md` file which also contains a lists of operations needed to include drivers for `oracle`, `mysql`, `mssql` databases.

### PostgreSQL: add support

No further actions needed.

### Oracle Database: add support

**In the template repository**, to enable Oracle Database support actions are needed:

1. edit the value of `DOCKER_TARGET` variable in `.gitlab-ci.yml` to `oracle` or alternatively select it on manual run
2. embed oracle drivers (see [embed drivers](#embed-drivers))
3. [optional] add `tnsnames.ora` and/or `Oracle Wallet` (see [add tns/wallet](#add-tns-support)).

#### Embed drivers

**In the template repository**, download drivers from the [official page](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client/linux-x86-64-downloads.html) according with the version you need.

The following assets are needed:

1. ODBC driver
2. instantclient basiclite

```shell
# on unix
export ORACLE_CLIENT_VERSION="<VERSION>"
unzip -j instantclient-basiclite-linux.x64-${ORACLE_CLIENT_VERSION}dbru.zip "instantclient_*/lib*" -d lib/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/oracle
unzip -j instantclient-odbc-linux.x64-${ORACLE_CLIENT_VERSION}dbru.zip "instantclient_*/lib*" -d lib/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/oracle
```

create a symlink

```shell
export LIBSQORA_NAME=`ls lib/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/oracle | grep -E -i '^libsqora\.so\.'`
ln -s "${LIBSQORA_NAME}" lib/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/oracle/libsqora.so
```

#### Add TNS support

Oracle connectivity can be handled with `tnsnames.ora` files and/or wallets. The container expects such assets in the `/home/agent/oracle/admin` folder. The `TNS_ADMIN` is already set to `/home/agent/oracle/admin` and the container will copy the content of the `oracle/admin` folder in this repository.

Drop your wallet assets or `tnsnames.ora` file in `oracle/admin` to include them.

In case you want to use a wallet remind to [tune] the `sqlora.net` file registering the `/home/agent/oracle/admin` path:

> WALLET_LOCATION = (SOURCE = (METHOD = file) (METHOD_DATA = (DIRECTORY="/home/agent/oracle/admin")))
> SSL_SERVER_DN_MATCH=yes

### MySQL: add support

**In the template repository**, ODBC driver for MySQL must be downloaded from the [official website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/odbc/)
selecting:

1. version `8.3.0`
2. OS `Linux - Generic`
3. OS version `glibc 2.28 x86_64`

then run:

```shell
export MYSQL_NAME=mysql-connector-odbc-8.3.0-linux-glibc2.28-x86-64bit
tar -xvf ${MYSQL_NAME}.tar.gz ${MYSQL_NAME}/lib/libmyodbc8w.so
mv ${MYSQL_NAME}/lib/* lib/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/mysql
```

### MS SQL Server: add support

No further actions beside editing `.gitlab-ci.yml` are required.

## Cronjob Configuration

From your project select `CronJobs` > `Create new CronJob`, insert a unique name for the job, an optional description, the full name of the docker image created by your CI job. It will come in the form `<URL TO REGISTRY>/<NAME OF PROJECT>/data-catalog-agent:<TAG>`. Also insert a `CronJob schedule` using the [k8s syntax](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/#writing-a-cronjob-spec).

By clicking on create, you need to configure:

1. the config map containing the configuration of the _Data Catalog Agent_
2. the cronjob yaml file

Create a new config map giving it a name of your choice (e.g., `data-catalog-agent-configuration`) and mount path `/home/agent/.config/dc/agent/`. We can now add it to the `CronJob` yaml manifest.

The prompted yaml for the `CronJob` should be edited as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  ...
spec:
  ...
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      ...
      template:
        ...
        spec:
          ...
          containers:
            containers:
            - name: ...
              ...
              env:
              - name: TNS_ADMIN # not required if it defaults to /home/agent/oracle/admin or no oracle support is needed
                value: /path/to/tns/admin/folder
              args: ["scan"] # add args here
              volumeMounts:
                - name: data-catalog-agent-configuration # reference a volume mount
                  mountPath: /home/agent/.config/dc/agent/
          volumes:
            - name: data-catalog-agent-configuration # use the name given to the config map
              configMap:
                name: data-catalog-agent-configuration
```

Now create a new file in the config map called `configuration.json`. This file must be a valid _Data Catalog Agent_ <a download target="_blank" href="/docs_files_to_download/data-catalog-agent/configuration.schema.json">configuration</a>.

## Data Catalog Agent Configuration

:::caution
The configuration is read from a file which must be located ad `~/.config/dc/agent/configuration.json` where `~` is the user's home folder (`$HOME`). Such location can be overridden via the environment variable `DC_AGENT_CONFIGURATION_FILEPATH` which must contain a filepath to a valid configuration file.
:::

The configuration has the following main sections:

1. connections
2. target

```json
{
  "connections": {
    ...
  },
  "target": {
    ...
  }
}
```

### Connections

A list of entries to connect to datasources via supported integration methods. The general recipe is:

```json
{
  "connections": {
    "<CONNECTION_NAME>": {
      "type": "<INTEGRATION_METHOD>",
      "configuration": {
        // depends on the integration method
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Available integration methods are:

- [`odbc`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Database_Connectivity)

Such drivers come often in the form of a [`dynamic shared object`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_library) and must be embedded with the binary and available at runtime (see the template repository README file).

#### PostgreSQL

To configure a **PostgreSQL** connection use:

```json
{
  "connections": {
    "<CONNECTION_NAME>": {  // ðŸ‘ˆ pick a name
      "type": "odbc",
      "configuration": {
        "vendor": "postgres",
        "params": {
          "uid": "test_user",
          "pwd": "password",
          "database": "<DATABASE_NAME>"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Other keys are `host` and `port` which for a **PostgreSQL** connection are defaulted to `0.0.0.0` and `5432`. Any other configuration parameter can be appended using the key `flags` which must be a semicolon separated string.

#### Oracle

To configure an **Oracle** connection use:

```json
{
  "connections": {
    "<CONNECTION_NAME>": {  // ðŸ‘ˆ pick a name
      "type": "odbc",
      "configuration": {
        "vendor": "oracle",
        "params": {
          "uid": "test_user",
          "pwd": "password",
          "dbq": "<SERVICE_NAME>"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`SERVICE_NAME` is an entry of your [`tnsnames.ora`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/18/netrf/local-naming-parameters-in-tnsnames-ora-file.html#GUID-12C94B15-2CE1-4B98-9D0C-8226A9DDF4CB) file. Such file **MUST** be available when running the binary and its location **MUST** be exported to an environment variable unless defaulted to `/home/agent/oracle/admin`.

in case you don't want to add the environment variable, the content of one entry of the `tnsnames.ora` file can be inlined such as:

```json
{
  "connections": {
    "<CONNECTION_NAME>": {
      "type": "odbc",
      "configuration": {
        "vendor": "oracle",
        "params": {
          ...,
          "dbq": "(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=0.0.0.0)(PORT=5041))(CONN ..."
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Other keys are:

- `version` which can be neglected **UNLESS USING ORACLE 11g** since it [does not support](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/LNPLS/release_changes.htm#LNPLS113) pagination via `OFFSET ? ROWS FETCH FIRST ? ROWS ONLY`.
- `flags` which will be added, as a string, to the connection like `"flags": "DBA=R;"`, for the available flags check [oracle documentation: 25.4.1 Format of the Connection String](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/adfns/odbc-driver.html#GUID-618B141E-DD46-4907-99C2-486E801CA878).

:::caution
`version` MUST be explicit if "11".
:::

Connection with an [oracle wallet](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/dbimi/using-oracle-wallet-manager.html#GUID-D0AA8373-B0AC-4DD8-9FA9-403E345E5A71) is also [supported](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/serverless/adbsb/connect-prepare-oci-wallets.html#GUID-EFAFA00E-54CC-47C7-8C71-E7868279EF3B):

Preparation must be done on the template repository:

1. The whole wallet content must be available under the same path of the `tnsnames.ora` (they usually come together)
2. The file `sqlora.net` inside the wallet must be updated to reflect the `TNS_ADMIN` path
   > WALLET_LOCATION = (SOURCE = (METHOD = file) (METHOD_DATA = (DIRECTORY="/path/to/folder")))
   > SSL_SERVER_DN_MATCH=yes

Also the environment variable must be set:

1. The `TNS_ADMIN` environment variable must be set **explicitly** unless defaulted to `/home/agent/oracle/admin`

#### MS SQL server

To configure a **MS SQL Server** connection use:

```json
{
  "connections": {
    "<CONNECTION_NAME>": {
      "type": "odbc",
      "configuration": {
        "vendor": "mssql",
        "params": {
          "uid": "test_user",
          "pwd": "password",
          "database": "<DATABASE_NAME>"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Other keys are `host` and `port` which for a **PostgreSQL** connection are defaulted to `0.0.0.0` and `1433`. Any [extra connection property](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/dsn-connection-string-attribute?view=sql-server-ver16) can be added via the key `flags` which will be added, as a string, to the connection, as a semicolon separated string. It is quite useful, for local development purposes to add the flag `"TrustServerCertificate=yes"`.

#### MySQL

To configure a **MySQL** connection use:

```json
{
  "connections": {
    "<CONNECTION_NAME>": {
      "type": "odbc",
      "configuration": {
        "vendor": "mysql",
        "params": {
          "uid": "test_user",
          "pwd": "password",
          "database": "<DATABASE_NAME>"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Other keys are `host` and `port` which for a **PostgreSQL** connection are defaulted to `0.0.0.0` and `3306`. Any [extra connection property](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-odbc/en/connector-odbc-configuration-connection-parameters.html) can be added via the key `flags` which will be added, as a string, to the connection, as a semicolon separated string.

### Targets

There are 3 targets available:

1. [**default**] stdout
2. file
3. mia-console

For each listed connection, after metadata is retrieved, `agent` **sequentially** sends data to the target as:

- `json` for `stdout` and `file`
- [`ndjson`](https://ndjson.org/) for `mia-console`

The final content is an `array` of models. Model spec is given in the form of a <a download target="_blank" href="/docs_files_to_download/data-catalog-agent/model.schema.json">JSON schema</a>.

To explicitly configure the `stdout` target use:

```json
{
  ...,
  "target": {
    "type": "stdout"
  }
}
```

To configure the `file` target use:

```json
{
  ...,
  "target": {
    "type": "file"
  }
}
```

which will save output files in the folder `./output`. To override this use:

```json
{
  ...,
  "target": {
    "type": "file",
    "dir": "/path/to/dir"
  }
}
```

To configure the `mia-console` target use:

```json
{
  ...,
  "target": {
    "type": "mia-console",
    "baseUrl": "https://my-server-url", // ðŸ‘ˆ mia console base url
    "projectId": "1234", // ðŸ‘ˆ models are pushed towards the project with this id
    "apiKey": "1234", // ðŸ‘ˆ mia console api key, may vary across test/preview/prod environments
    "credentials": {
      // machine to machine credentials
    }
  }
}
```

credentials are used to [obtain](https://mia-platform.eu/blog/client-credentials-m2m-authentication-oauth/) an access token. In order to do that you must provide:

```json
{
  ...,
  "target": {
    ...,
    "credentials": {
      "clientId": "1234",
      "clientKeyId": "123",
      "privateKey": "tls/key.pem" // ðŸ‘ˆ either a file system path or an rsa private key inlined with `\n`
    }
  }
}
```

on `type` `mia-console` the auth endpoint can be customized using `oauthTokenEndpoint`. The service endpoint hosted on `mia-console` can be overridden in 2 ways:

1. customizing the revision using the field `revision`
2. or customizing the overall url using the field `dataCatalogEndpoint`
