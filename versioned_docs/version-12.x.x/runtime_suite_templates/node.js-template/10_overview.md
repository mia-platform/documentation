`Node.js Template` is the best template to start creating a service in node, integrated inside your platform.  

This template leverages Mia Platform [custom-plugin-lib](https://github.com/mia-platform/custom-plugin-lib).  
`custom-plugin-lib` is a [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) library developed by Mia-Platform. This library contains configurations and functions that will help you to modify your template with easiness.

If you want to learn how to modify this template and create your node microservice with custom logic, follow this [walkthrough](./walkthrough).
