Projection Storer is one of the Fast Data components, which it acts as an entrypoint to the system. Its role is to ingest change events coming from the
origin system ([System of Record](/fast_data/the_basics.md#system-of-record-sor)) and process them by cleaning, filtering,
validating and eventually storing them as raw data for the system.

The service consumes Kafka messages as [_ingestion events_](/fast_data/inputs_and_outputs.md#ingestion-message) and for each
input change event produces as output the corresponding [_projection record update event_](/fast_data/inputs_and_outputs.md#projection-update-message).

:::note
Projection Storer service generates _projection record update events_ that adopt the `v2.0.0` schema, which differ slightly
from the events generated by the [Real-Time Updater](/fast_data/realtime_updater.md) service, which uses the `v1.0.0` schema. Nonetheless, both event schemas are
supported, recognized and handled correctly by downstream components.

### Comparison with Real-Time Updater

Projection Storer features partially overlap with the ones of [Real-Time Updater](/fast_data/realtime_updater.md) service. In fact,
Projection Storer implements a comparable processing logic for consuming ingestion events, storing projection records and notifying
changes via projection record update events.  
When Fast Data is configured adopting [Event-Driven architecture](/fast_data/architecture.md#event-driven-architecture), the Projection Storer can be employed as a drop-in
replacement of Real-Time Updater service.

Nonetheless, when compared to the Real-Time Updater, Projection Storer offers an overhauled and simpler configuration experience and an increased processing throughput.

Below is provided a brief comparison table between the two services:

\* Fast Data can be plugged to any Event Streaming Platform that support Kafka Protocols. For example, it is also compatible
with [Azure Event Hubs for Apache Kafka](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/azure-event-hubs-kafka-overview). 

### Projection Storer Configurations

To learn more about Projection Storer configuration, it is possible to read the details in the following [page](/fast_data/configuration/projection_storer.md).  
Furthermore, it is also available a [migration guide](/fast_data/configuration/projection_storer.md#migration-guide),
which explains how to update Fast Data configurations, so that a Projection Storer can replace an existing Real-Time Updater.
