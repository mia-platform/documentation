### Fixed

## [1.2.0] 2022-06-21

### Breaking changes

- If you want to continue using auth0 dependency, in an existing project, make sure `AUTH_SERVICE` env variable is set (`auth0-client` was set as default value in previous versions).
- In order to update to this version, you must change your CRUD service's schema (and eventually consequently update existing data in mongo):
  - _User Id Map_ collection: `auth0Id` must be changed with `receivedUserId`
  - _Teleconsultations_ collection: `participantsNumber`,  `startDate`, `endDate` must be added
- `/telecons-fe/teleconsultation` endpoint must be removed from console project

### Added

- Auth0 dependency isn't mandatory anymore. This is a **breaking change**. 
- Partial participant list can be provided to `POST /teleconsultation` request
- Added endpoint (`POST /teleconsultation/:id/participants/data`) to add a new participant to an existing teleconsultation 

### Fixed

- Fixed permission handling: if some user doesn't have a group included in the ones defined in the service configuration, an error is returned to the caller.

## [1.1.2] 2022-05-04

- Added env var UNLIMITED_TELECONSULTATION (if set to true, the timer will not appear during the call)
