In order to configure the Form Service with the Console you need to deploy two services, **Chat Service Backend** and the **Chat Service Frontend**. Both are available in the Marketplace.

1. To display the Chat Service Frontend UI, create the service searching for it in the Console Marketplace. Choose a name for the new service (e.g. `chat-service-frontend`).
2. Create the endpoint for the newly created microservice, for example `/chat-service`.
3. Be sure the Chat Service Backend has been configured to ensure the route `GET /chat/config?clientType=web` is properly served.

Configure the **Chat Service Backend** following [this guide](https://git.tools.mia-platform.eu/mia-care/platform/plugins/chat-service-backend/-/blob/master/docs/20_configuration.md) before using the **Chat Service Frontend**.

## Integration
Once configured the endpoints of the Form Service, you can use it as a micro-lc plugin following this [guide](https://microlc.io/documentation/docs/micro-lc/plugin_configuration) or as a CMS custom frontend following this [guide](../../microfrontend-composer/previous-tools/cms/custom-frontends-integration-CMS.md).

### Integration with micro-lc

In order to use the Form Service Frontend integrated with micro-lc, the [core configuration plugin parameters documentation](https://microlc.io/documentation/docs/micro-lc/core_configuration#plugin-parameters) should also be consulted. As an example, with a frontend service endpoint equal to `/form-service` and a `qiankun` plugin integration `qiankun`, developers can add a Form Builder plugin using this example micro-lc `plugins` configuration:

```json
{
  ...
 "plugins": [
    {
      "id": "chats",
      "label": "Chat",
      "icon": "fas fa-file-alt",
      "order": 0,
      "integrationMode": "qiankun",
      "pluginRoute": "/chat-service",
      "pluginUrl": "/chat-service/",
      "props": {}
    }
 ]
 ...
}
```

#### Advanced configurations

It's possible to take advantage of the microlc prop forwarding and Stream Chat Filters to create custom configurations.
For example, the following is the configuration for 

```json
{
      "id": "chats",
      "label": "Chat",
      "aclExpression": "groups.superadmin || groups.admin || groups.doctor",
      "icon": "fas fa-comment",
      "order": 400,
      "content": [
        {
          "id": "opened-chats",
          "label": "Chat aperte",
          "order": 401,
          "integrationMode": "qiankun",
          "pluginRoute": "/opened-chats/",
          "pluginUrl": "/chat-service/'",
          "props": {
            "filters": {
              "frozen": false
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "id": "closed-chats",
          "label": "Chat chiuse",
          "order": 402,
          "integrationMode": "qiankun",
          "pluginRoute": "/closed-chats/",
          "pluginUrl": "/chat-service/",
          "props": {
            "filters": {
              "frozen": true
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
