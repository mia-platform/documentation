Custom styling and UI configuration can be provided to the service by editing the configMap of the Chat Service Backend.
Its possible in  this way to pass to the app the following options:

### Theming

Global style options (primary colors, fonts, ...) can be configured by setting the following css variables options according to the Stream sdk specification: 

```json
{
  ...
  "options": {
    ...
    "theme": {
      "--primary-color": "var(--microlc-primary-color)",
      "--grey-gainsboro": "var(--microlc-footer-background)",
      "--grey-whisper": "var(--microlc-primary-color-tint-89)",
      ...
      "--white-snow": "#F0F0EC",
      "--border": "none"
    },
    ...
  }
}
```

For a full list of the available variables, please refer to the [Stream SDK Documentation](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/sdk/react/customization/css_and_theming/#css-variables).
