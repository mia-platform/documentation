The teleconsultation service relies on the [SaaS Bandyer Service][bandyer] to create a video call between two or more people, providing also a variety of tools, like chat, whiteboard, screen sharing, file upload, etcetera.

The **Teleconsultation Service Frontend** handles and visualizes the teleconsultation UI and all its relative tools for the call using iframe.

It has one Back End, the [Teleconsultation Service Backend][teleconsultation-service-be], which allows you to handle all the necessary operations (create, update, delete), on the teleconsultations. The Back End uses the [RESTful APIs][bandyer-rest-api] provided by Kaleyra.
