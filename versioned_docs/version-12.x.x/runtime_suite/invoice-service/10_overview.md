This plugin provides a simple way to generate payment invoices in a pdf format, starting from a static and general template. The template contains customizable information that can be retrieved from the request of the specified endpoint.
The template is generated using PDF Make library.

## Overview
For each request, the service:
- retrieves from the request body the data that will go in the payment invoice
- generates a PDF file which will contain the invoice of a payment/order
