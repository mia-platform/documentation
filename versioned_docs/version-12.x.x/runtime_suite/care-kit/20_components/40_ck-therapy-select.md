The `ck-therapy-select` web component is used to select a therapy/monitoring between the ones associated to a specific user. The selection of a option will trigger the emission of `therapy-config` event.

## Usage
The `ck-therapy-select` component recovers the therapies/monitorings associated to a specific user. The data received are used to populate the selectable options. The web-component's `type` property defines if therapies or monitorings are fetched. The property accepts two values `monitoring` and `therapy`.
The other property, `planBasePath`, has to be set to the endpoint that expose the [Therapy and Monitoring Manager service](../../therapy-and-monitoring-manager/overview). 

Properties `urlMask` and `idKey` are used to retrieve the patient id from the url: `idKey` is the dynamic value key mapped in the `urlMask`. For example, if the url is `/dashboard/85fh30?pageSize=25` where `85fh30` is the patient id, the `urlMask` will be `/dashboard/:<yourKey>` and `patientIdKey` will be `<yourKey>`. The `patientId` retrieved is used to filter the select's option.

On initialization, after the options have been retrieved, the first options is selected (if present). Every time an option is selected a `therapy-config` event, containing the information of the selected value, is sent. Alongside the `therapy-config` event, selecting an options also triggers the emitting of the events [change-query](../../../microfrontend-composer/back-kit/events#change-query) and `chart-filters` both containt in the payload a `Filter` object having as property `planId`, operator `equal` and as value the `planId` of the selected option.

 If no options are presents the select will be disabled.
