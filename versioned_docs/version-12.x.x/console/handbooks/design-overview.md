Design Overview allows you to create and manage multiple Views (aka Public Views), each one with its own set of filters and visible columns for each available Resource for a Company.
There are a different set of permissions based on whether you want to create or edit a View, make sure you have the ones you need.

:::note
To create a new View you must have the permission `console.company.project.create`.
:::

## View creation

To create the View, simply choose from the table the Company in which to create it, then go to Design Overview and select the tab from available Resources ([CRUD](/development_suite/governance/design-overview.md#CRUD), [Endpoints](/development_suite/governance/design-overview.md#Endpoints), [Microservices](/development_suite/governance/design-overview.md#Microservices)).

Customize the table based on your needs by hiding/displaying column and/or applying filters.

Finally use the `Save current view` button to insert View name and the `Save view` button to persist the current view.

The saved view is visible in the Design Overview's Homepage section.
