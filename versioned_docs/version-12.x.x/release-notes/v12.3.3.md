## Console

### Bug Fix

This version addressed the following bug:  
* When a project is created using the `Empty` template and the git provider is either `azure` or `bitbucket` the user is not able to commit changes to the repository.

## How to update your Console

For self-hosted installations, please head to the [self hosted upgrade guide](/infrastructure/self-hosted/installation-chart/100_how-to-upgrade.md#v12---version-upgrades) or contact your Mia-Platform referent and upgrade to _Console Helm Chart_ `v13.0.3`.
