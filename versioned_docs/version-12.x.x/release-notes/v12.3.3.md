## Fast Data

### Bug Fix

This version addressed the following bug:  
* When using custom [cast functions](/fast_data/configuration/projection_storer.md#cast-functions-and-additional-cast-functions) in your Fast Data Project, the configuration for the Projection Storer now contains all the custom cast functions instead of just the ones from the first projection associated to the service.

## How to update your Console

For self-hosted installations, please head to the [self hosted upgrade guide](/infrastructure/self-hosted/installation-chart/100_how-to-upgrade.md#v12---version-upgrades) or contact your Mia-Platform referent and upgrade to _Console Helm Chart_ `v13.0.3`.
