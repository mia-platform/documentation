## Fast Data

### New Features

#### Real Time Updater v7.2.0 now supports OAuthbearer Kafka Authentication

Added the support to [**OAuthbearer** Kafka authentication](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/kafka/authentication_sasl/authentication_sasl_oauth.html) in Real-Time Updater `v7.2.0`.

### Improvements

#### Real Time Updater v7.2.0 better manages the strategies

Another _strategy for handling record processing errors_ was added. The default Real-Time Updater behavior was to restart itself due to the error, so that it could to re-process the failing record.
  Differently, the newer strategy stops the service reading from the topic containing the failed record, while it instead continues reading from all the other configured topics.  
  This newer strategy can be enabled setting environment variable `PAUSE_TOPIC_CONSUMPTION_ON_ERROR` to `true`.

:::note
When enabling such feature, it is advised to set an alarm on _consumer group lag accumulation_ to get notified when an error of this type occurs and near real-time property is lost for entailed topic. In this manner it is possible to timely react to the situation.
:::

#### Updated Kafka message adapter `Basic` label to `DB2`

The message adapter label is now reflecting the CDC that generates this message format (IBM InfoSphere Data Replication for DB2).

### Bug Fix

#### Fixed scroll of Edit SVC Configurations Modal inside Single Views section

The Edit SVC Configuration Modal is now correctly scrollable.

#### Fixed bug on MongoDB CRUD section by removing the `usePartialFilter` property from indexes when its value is false

The older CRUD service versions (before `v6.1.0`), when using partial indexes, are not crushing anymore after a wrong configuration of the partial indexes.

#### Real Time Updater v7.2.0 fixes the management of Dates in Primary keys

The dates in primary keys are now correctly handled.

#### Real Time Updater v7.2.0 fixes improper behavior of Kafka Projections Changes

Kafka Projections Changes are now correctly disabled when the variable `PROJECTIONS_CHANGES_ENABLED` is set to `false`.

#### Real Time Updater v7.2.0 fixes improper behavior of `upsert` mode

When the Real-Time Updater is configured in `upsert` mode, `DELETE` operations of records whose `__internal_counter` was lower than the one stored on the database resulted into `INSERT` operations with all the projections' field set to `null`. That situation could lead the Real-Time Updater to continuosly restard due to a _duplicate key error_. Now those `DELETE` operations are handled correctly.
