---

:::caution
This Plugin is a BETA Plugin and, as such, is currently under active development. Pay attention using it.
:::

The Single View Trigger Generator has 3 fundamental parts:

- The consumption of pr-update messages
- The strategy execution
- The production of sv-trigger messages

For each part we will need to configure a set of [environment variables](#environment-variables) and [config maps](#config-maps).

:::caution
Remember that the Single View Trigger Generator uses Kafka throughout the whole cycle and must be configured accordingly. To know more about the main changes from the old architecture please read the [Single View Trigger Generator introduction](/fast_data/single_view_trigger_generator.md) page.

## Environment variables

The following table indicates all the available environment variables for you to customize the service to your needs.

:::note
When creating the service from the marketplace the following environment variables will be added for you with some default values but you still need to properly update them to make the service work

## Config Maps

The service can use the following 3 config maps:

:::note
When creating the service from the marketplace the following config maps will be created for you with some default values but you still need to properly configure them to make the service work
:::

### ER Schema

The ER Schema config map contains the `erSchema.json` file which describes the relationships between each projection of the [System of Record/s](/fast_data/the_basics.md#system-of-records-sor).

Remember to copy/paste the mount path into the `ER_SCHEMA_FOLDER` environment variable so the service can read the file.
To know more on how to configure the file please go to the [ER Schema](/fast_data/configuration/config_maps/erSchema.md) page.

### Projection Changes Schema

The Projection Changes Schema config map contains the `projectionChangesSchema.json` file which defines how to get to the base projection of the single view starting from the projection in which we received the ingestion message. 

Remember to copy/paste the mount path into the `PROJECTION_CHANGES_SCHEMA_FOLDER` environment variable so the service can read the file.
If you need more info on how to configure the `projectionChangesSchema.json` file, please refer to the [Projection Changes Schema](/fast_data/configuration/config_maps/projection_changes_schema.md) page.

### Kafka Projection Updates

The Kafka Projection Updates config map contains the `kafkaProjectionUpdates.json` file which defines the topics from where to consume the [Projection Updates](/fast_data/inputs_and_outputs.md#projection-update) and the strategy to apply to each message.

Remember to copy/paste the mount path into the `KAFKA_PROJECTION_UPDATES_FOLDER` environment variable so the service can read the file.
If you need more info on how to configure the `kafkaProjectionUpdates.json` file, please refer to the [Kafka Projection Updates](/fast_data/configuration/config_maps/kafka_projection_updates.md) page.
