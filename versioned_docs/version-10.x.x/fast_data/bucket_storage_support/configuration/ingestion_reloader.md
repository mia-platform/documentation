sidebar_label: Ingestion Reloader
---

This page describes how to configure the Ingestion Reloader service, that performs the "reingestion" of the messages (the publishing of old ingestion messages stored on the bucket), to a specified Kafka topic.

## Overview

The reingestion is triggered by a `POST` route, and 3 types of reingestions are supported.

- **File Reingestion**: where the user defines a specific file on the bucket to be reingested to the Kafka topic
- **Topic Reingestion** where the user defines an entire topic to be reingested on the Kafka topic.
  It's also possible to specify a Date interval for the files' selection.

## Service Configuration

In order to connect and authenticate correctly with the bucket and Kafka, please check the relative pages:

* [Bucket connection](/fast_data/bucket_storage_support/configuration/bucket_connection.md)
* [Kafka connection](/fast_data/bucket_storage_support/configuration/kafka_connection.md)

The Ingestion Reloader exposes four `POST` routes to trigger its functionalities.

### Reingestion of a Topic

This route allows the user to reingest a topic partially or from the beginning.
The user has to specify the "stored" topic name and the "reingestion" topic name, optionally a filter on the timestamp of the topic may also be specified (with the `startDate` and `stopDate` properties). In this last case, only the records included in the specified time interval will be reingested on the selected topic.

### Reingestion of a File

This route allows the user to reingest a single file from the bucket into the topic specified in the request.
The user has to specify the file name and the reingestion topic.

### Stopping reingestion

This route allows the user to stop the ongoing reingestion of a topic.
The user has to specify the _ingestion_ topic that is currently being reingested.

:::caution
This route can stop only the reingestion of a topic, not the one of a single file.
