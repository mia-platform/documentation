This Dashboard is mainly concerned with Single Views related concepts, and a Single View Creator service is required for exposing the metrics of interest.

### Single View Creator Service

When working with Fast Data, you should already have one or more Single View Creator services, which will expose the relevant metrics. No additional configuration is needed.

The metrics exposed by the Single View Creator Service are:

| Metric Name                        | Description                                                                                        | Buckets (ms)                                                      | Available since version |
