The Real-Time Updater service consumes [kafka messages](https://kafka.apache.org/intro#intro_concepts_and_terms) in order to keep the fast data projection collections up to date with the connected system.

A Real-Time Updater service is automatically created when you create a new System.
After the new configuration has been saved, this service is visible as one of your services in the `Microservices` section.

## Projection Update

Two actions are necessary for the Real-Time Updater in order to correctly update its projections:

- You must define at least one custom field with the following flags set to true: **Primary Key**, **Required**.
- You must create an index using the previously defined custom field and set the flag **Unique** to true.

When a change occurs in the connected System, it sends a Kafka message to the ingestion topics to trigger the change. This change is propagated to the projections. When a projection is updated, an event of that update can be produced on Kafka in order to notify that a specific projection has changed. This allows you to have interesting architecture reactive on events involving your projections.

## Trigger the update of a Single View

When a projection is updated, Real-Time Updater will generate an event telling that a specific Single View needs to be updated since it depends on the Projection updated. This event can be generated whether by upserting a `Projection Changes` collection or by producing a Kafka Message. A [Single View Creator](https://kafka.apache.org/intro#intro_concepts_and_terms) is expected to be consuming the event.

### Real Time Updater Configurations

To know more about Real-Time Updater service Configurations you can go [here](/fast_data/configuration/realtime_updater/common.md)

As previously stated, when a projection is updated, Real-Time Updater will generate an event telling that a specific Single View needs to be updated. This event contains a reference to the identifier of the Single View document that have to be updated. 

To obtain the identifier of the Single View, the Real-Time Updater executes an algorithm called `strategy` that follows a path connecting projections, starting from the updated one and ending at the one containing the desired identifier.

This algorithm can be implemented using the [Real Time Updater Low Code](/fast_data/configuration/realtime_updater/low_code.md). It uses json files for configuration and the environment variables are already set with correct default values.
