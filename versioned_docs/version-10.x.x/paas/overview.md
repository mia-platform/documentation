Mia-Platform PaaS (Platform as a Service) is a **cloud application platform** that runs on top of infrastructure as a service and hosts software applications. It provides a fast, easy, and scalable way to run applications in the cloud, whether it is public, private, or hybrid cloud.

Mia-Platform allows organizations to focus on two main things: their **customers** and their **code**.
PaaS will take care about all the system administration details of setting up servers - usually those needed for application development. All the benefits with none of the commitment.

Mia-Platform PaaS frees developers from installing in-house hardware and software. It usually incorporates various underlying infrastructure components - like operating systems, servers, databases, middleware, networking equipment, and storage services. All these components are owned, operated, configured, and maintained by the service provider, not the business. The business just provides the data and applications.

## Mia-Platform PaaS benefits  

The primary benefits of PaaS are **simplicity** and **convenience** for users, but it also ensures other benefits, like the following ones:

* Decrease infrastructure management;
* Automate or eliminate maintenance tasks;
* Remove the complexity of load balancing, scaling, and distributing dependent services;
* Adopt new offerings and technologies without problems.
