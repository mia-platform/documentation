Fix:

- Error handling has been improved in order to wrap JsonMappingException messages and validation errors
- Url parsing method exceptions are managed properly for most of corner cases
- Refactoring to handle export settings via payload parameter
- Better handling for param "columns" which must be:
    - not required
    - not empty whether present
- Conversion method for Boolean values in different formats passed as configuration in the payload. Format supported are :
    - String "true"/"false"
    - Boolean true/false
    - Int 1/0
    - String "customTrueValue"/"customFalseValue"
- Unit Tests for all the above points
- Added tests to verify that Content-Disposition is missing from the Response Headers
    
Misc:

- Swagger UI 
- Added Stress Tests with artillery
