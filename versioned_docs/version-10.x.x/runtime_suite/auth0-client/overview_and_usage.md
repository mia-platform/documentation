This service handles authentication and user management using Auth0 as identity provider.

This service exposes different endpoints to handle authentication: `/authorize`, `/oauth/token`, `/refreshtoken`, `/logout` and `/userinfo` endpoints. A `/users/me` endpoint is also exposed for backward compatibility but its use is discouraged.

Moreover, it handles users through the auth0 users management api.

## How to enable username and password login

A Grant-Type property let you define a method from which your application can gain Access Tokens, for a more detailed explanation follow the official [auth0 documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/applications/application-grant-types).

To setup, firstly, you must have a working tenant on Auth0, where your application has enabled different database's connections (e.g. **Username-Password-Authentication**). Then, in the advanced settings of your application, you should enable `Password` in `Grant Types`. You have to add the necessary **Rules**, see [Config Auth0](./configure_auth0.md).

In Tenant Setting, at **API Authorization Settings** you set a Default Directory and a Default Audience, which is the name of the connection to be use for Password Grant exchanges.

After everything is set, you can check it by using the following curl:

```bash
curl --location \
    -X POST 'https://YOUR_PROJECT_URL/oauth/token' \
    --header 'secret: YOUR_SECRET' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
    --data-urlencode 'grant_type=your_grand_type' \
    --data-urlencode 'username=your_username' \
    --data-urlencode 'password=your_name' \
    --data-urlencode 'connection=your_connection'
```

:::note
To notice that the connection is not required if you have one connection.

Multi-connections are usually used to manage multi-environment but you can still
have one environment with multi-connections.

If all went well, you should get, without the scope **website**:

```json
{
  "refreshToken": "your_refresh_token",
  "accessToken": "your_access_token",
  "idToken": "your_id_token",
  "expireAt": "2021-07-16T08:28:24.568365226Z"
}
```

Using the scope **website**:

```json
{
    "cookie_sid": "your_cookie_sid"
}
```

When the token expires refresh token could be used to get a new access token:

```bash
curl --location \
    -X POST 'https://YOUR_PROJECT_URL/oauth/refreshtoken' \
    --header 'secret: YOUR_SECRET' \
    --header 'Content-type: application/json' \
    --header 'authorization: Bearer your_access_token' \
    -d '{ "refresh_token": "your_refresh_token" }'
```

:::note
Note for the project configuration: the endpoint path depends on how the oauth0-client is exposed on the api-gateway, the exposed path by oauth0-client is `/refreshtoken`.
:::

The response contains a new access token and new refresh token.

```json
{
  "refreshToken": "your_new_refresh_token",
  "accessToken": "your_new_access_token",
  "idToken":"your_id_token",
  "expireAt":"2021-07-16T09:53:16.653155743Z"
}
```

In the following an example of how to call an authenticated API using the token:

```bash
curl --location \
    'https://YOUR_PROJECT_URL/YOUR_RESOURCE_PATH/' \
    --header 'secret: YOUR_SECRET' \
    --header 'authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'
```

## How to configure multiple environment

If you want to segregate users for each runtime environment, the simpler solution is to:

1. Create different databases, one for each environment you want; go to [Auth0 Management Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/) and from the *Authentication* section create new databases
1. While still in Auth0 Management Dashboard, you'll have to allow the database (called `connection`) for each application
(you might also define different applications for different environments, in this scenario you'd have to allow the proper connections to your applications)

1. In the Console `Setup Infrastructure` section of your project add a variable for each environment (e.g. `DEV_AUTH0_CONNECTION`, `PREPROD_AUTH0_CONNECTION`, `PROD_AUTH0_CONNECTION`) and specify the proper database `connection` name for each environment.
2. In the Console `Design` section modify `auth0-client` configuration for the `managementClient` in order to use the newly created interpolation variable (e.g. `AUTH0_CONNECTION`) for `supportedConnections` and `defaultCreateUserConnection`, and
3. Make sure that `supportedConnections` is declared for each `client` too, specifying only the connection you want to support in each environment.
4. Make sure that `supportedConnections` and `defaultConnection` is declared for `cms` client too, specifying only the connection you want to support in that environment.
