## How to change the name of core services

Action:

1. Go to **Section: api-console-config/ core-service.json**

2. Here you fill find an empty file.

If you want to change the name of a service you will need to compile a json file with the structure similar to the one shown below:

```
{
    "ag-1": {
        "type": "core",
        "name": "ag-1",
        "key": "api-gateway"
    },
    "microservice-gateway-1": {
        "type": "core",
        "name": "microservice-gateway-1",
        "key": "microservice-gateway"
    }
}
```

**type**: is the type of the services

**name**: is the name you wanna give to your service

**key**: is the real name of the service

:::warning
Watch out!
Remember to delete old services and related files: service, deployment and any config map
