Thanks to our Console in the Settings area it is possible to manage your Environment Variables.

## How to differentiate your variable from one environment to another

Mia-Platform uses the **prefix** concept to manage the differentiation between variables.

Each variable can be associated with a prefix indicating the environment in which the variable is to be interpolated.

How do prefixes work?

Prefixes can be of two types:

* **Global prefix**: Mia Platform uses `​​MIA_` as global prefix. However, it is possible to avoid the prefix and by default, the environment variable will be treated as global.

* **Differentiated**: according to the environment

When a project is created it is associated to a specific Company.
As described in the [Company section](/development_suite/set-up-infrastructure/create-project.mdx#create-a-company) a project associated to a specific company will inherit the environment information. For this reason, a differentiated environment variable must have the prefix associated to the `ID` of the specific environment. 
It is possible to find it in the table of the Envs area.

:::warning
Remember! It is fundamental to define a prefix if you want to associate a variable to a particular environment, otherwise the variable will be considered global.

## Create a Variable

When you start a new project you will find variables already configured.
To add a new variable press the **"Add new environment variable"** button at the top-right of the table and fill in the form:

* the **key** is mandatory and identifies your variable. Remember **to use the prefix** to manage the differentiation between environment;
* the **value** is the value you want to attribute to your variable, the one that will be interpolated.

:::info
When a **value** contains some `$` characters it is required to escape it by adding another `$` just before the original ones, otherwise the variable will be truncated just before the dollar sign.

#### Example

* **Desired value** to interpolate: `var$var$var`;

* **Actual value** to write: `var$$var$$var`.

## Edit a Variable

Changing the value of an existing variable is very simple. Click on the **edit** button in the same row as the variable you want to edit.
Once you press the vsi button a modal will open.
The key is an unchangeable value.
Once the value has been changed, you just have to press the save button.

## Delete a Variable

To delete a variable, press the **delete** button corresponding to the desired variable. A modal will open.
To cancel the variable you will be asked to enter the name of the key. The **name of the key must be identical** otherwise you will not be able to delete it.
