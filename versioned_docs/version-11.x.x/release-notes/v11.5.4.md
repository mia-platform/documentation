## Console

### Hotfix: Backoffice Configuration clashes with MongoDB version <5.0

A problem has been fixed for the Backoffice Configuration, that prevented from saving the Console configuration, due to some clashing with special characters not correctly handled by older versions of MongoDB <5.0.

## How to update your Console

For on-premise installations, please contact your Mia-Platform referent and upgrade your _Console Helm Chart_ to `v9.5.5-hotfix.1`.
