## Console

### Bug Fix

This version addressed a bug that wrongly added additional parameters (`tags` and `enableLookup`) to CRUD service configuration. The CRUD service configuration is now correctly generated.

## How to update your Console

For on-premise installations, please contact your Mia-Platform referent and upgrade your _Console Helm Chart_ to `v9.5.1`.
