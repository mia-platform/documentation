## Console

### Hotfix: Fast Data deletes public variables

This version ships the hotfix for Public Variables for Fast Data deletion bug, if Fast Data is enabled, that was introduced with `v11.7.0`.

When saving in Design with `v11.7.0` Public Variables for Fast Data services that start with the `FAST_DATA` prefix are deleted and regenerated. This could lead to different Fast Data public variables leading to impossible deployment for Fast Data services.

Please mind that secret environment variables have not been affected by this bug.

#### How to resolve the issue if I've already saved

Unfortunately, the only way to retrieve the environment variables deleted is to revert the commit (or the commits) executed after the deploy of `v11.7.0`.

Otherwise, the environment variables have to be created again from the _Public variables_ in _Design_.

### Hotfix: Fast Data generates Projection Changes collection with interpolated variable names

This version ships the hotfix for a wrong generation of Fast Data Projection Changes Collection when the collection name has an interpolated variable that was introduced with `v11.7.0`.

When saving in Design with `v11.7.0` there could be the possibility that some Projection Changes Collection with a `{{<PC_COLLECTION_NAME>}}` name are created, which prevents from saving. 

#### How to resolve the issue if I've already saved

You can simply solve this issue by manually deleting the collections that have the `{{<PC_COLLECTION_NAME>}}` name and saving the configuration.

Of course, you can also revert the commit including the configuration update that generated the collection with the wrong name.

## How to update your Console

For on-premise installations, please contact your Mia-Platform referent and upgrade your _Console Helm Chart_ to `v9.5.13`.
