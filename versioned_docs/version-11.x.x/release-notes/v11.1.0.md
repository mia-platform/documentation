## Console

### New Features

#### User Groups Management

Company Owners can now manage users also through Groups from Mia-Platform Console.  
Thanks to groups it is possible to simplify and speed-up the management of a multitude of users who have to be assigned the same privileges.  
Users management through groups sits alongside the current individual identities access management, to allow you to better structure access to resources and fit your teams structure, giving you the freedom to choose how to govern access levels of your Company users.  

![Groups section](./img/overview/group_table.png)

To find out more about user groups management, just take a look at the related [documentation page](/development_suite/identity-and-access-management/manage-groups.md). 

#### Internal Marketplace for Companies

Along with the traditional public Marketplace, it is now possible for Companies to have their own Company-related Marketplace items; these items will only be available to Projects within the Company, allowing for a better definition of custom resources that can speed up your development process.   
These Company-related Marketplace items can be managed and created by Company Owners and Project Administrators and will then be visible only to members of that specific Company. 

To find out more information on how to manage Marketplace resources owned exclusively by the Company, visit the dedicated Marketplace [documentation page](/marketplace/add_to_marketplace/contributing_overview.md#public-and-internal-company-marketplace).

### Improvements

#### Check of Certificate Authority in cluster connection

During Cluster creation, adding the Certificate Authority is no more mandatory; based on your cluster setup you may still be required to provide a CA. Before connecting the Cluster to your Company, the Console will make sure that it can correctly reach the Cluster with a secure connection, meaning that if your Cluster uses self-signed certificate the CA will still be required.

### Bug Fix

This version addressed a few bugs, here is a comprehensive list:

* An error that caused the Debug Area of the Console to fail to load has been fixed;
* A bug in the Project creation that caused a malfunction in the display of the default CI/CD tool of each environment has been fixed;
* We solved an error that caused a malfunction of the multi-log functionality of Pods in the Runtime area;
* An issue that prevented the user to understand the type of error running in a Pod, by showing a generic "undefined" in the information popup, has been fixed;
* The Backoffice Configurator now correctly configures the `oneOf` properties, handling it properly in editing modal.

## Fast Data

### New Features

#### Ingestion Reloader

Introducing a new version of the Ingestion Reloader, the `1.2.0`! With this new verison, you can now filter specific messages retrieved from a bucket, using a custom selector system and allowing precise and targeted filtering of messages to be reingested: just specify the file with it in the `customSelectorName` field. The selector's configurations are available at the POST `/reingestion/file` and POST `/reingestion/topic` endpoints.

Go to the [official documentation](/fast_data/bucket_storage_support/configuration/ingestion_reloader.md) to find out more.

#### Debezium DB2 template
The rollout of the supported Debezium Templates is going on! You can now find in the Marketplace the [Debezium connector template for DB2](/fast_data/connectors/debezium_cdc.md#db2) databases with the pre-configured config map for Debezium Server to connect directly to a DB2 Database.

### Improvements

#### Updated delete modal inside the Fast Data section

The delete modal inside the System of Records, Projections and Single Views pages has been updated to support the automatic deletion of records and their dependencies. For example, when deleting a System of Record, it will not be necessary to manually delete all of its related Projections.

#### No Code ER Schema

A couple of improvements have been made to the No Code ER Schema canvas:

* the creation and editing of rules inside the relationship panel now includes a filter by type for Projection fields
* the relationship panel is automatically opened when creating a new relationship by connecting two Projections inside the canvas

## Marketplace

### New Marketplace Components

#### OpenAI Playground

This is a Next.js with React example in preview that allows you to try-out OpenAI APIs directly in Console. This service will help you leverage AI potentialities to answer any question you need to be answered.  
You can find more info [here](https://github.com/mia-platform-marketplace/open-ai-showcase).

### Marketplace Updates

#### Chat Service Frontend - v1.0.1

Fixed integration with [micro-lc](https://github.com/micro-lc) v2.

#### HTTP Proxy Manager - v2.0.0

HTTP Proxy Manager now handles path parameters inside `basePath` and `targetBaseUrl`, using the `{path-parameter}` syntax. You can also set `additionalHeaders` value to add a list of headers that will be added to the request to the external service.

#### User Manager Service - v1.4.1

Added a `TIMER_SERVICE_HEADERS` env var to proxy headers to the [Timer Service](/runtime_suite/timer-service/10_overview.md).
Fixed return when an error occurs in the `POST /users` endpoint.

### New Libraries

We are excited to announce the release of a new open-source library written in TypeScript that will help you easily check Kafka probes in your microservices: [Kafka HealthChecker](https://github.com/mia-platform/kafka-healthchecker). This library is designed to simplify the process of monitoring Kafka by accepting in input a list of producers and consumers and providing two methods that will check if your service is connected to Kafka and able to process new messages.

We have included detailed [documentation](/runtime_suite_libraries/kafka-healthchecker/10_overview.md) to help you get up and running with the library as quickly as possible.
