## Console

### Hotfix: collections with long names

This version addresses a bug that prevents the saving of the configuration when there is a _CRUD Collection_, _Projection_ or a _Single View_ with a name longer than 32 characters.  To resolve this issue, names of up to 80 characters are now supported.

## How to update your Console

For on-premise installations, please contact your Mia-Platform referent and upgrade your _Console Helm Chart_ to `9.5.11`.
