## Console

### Hotfix: Backoffice Configuration retains `meta` information

A problem has been fixed for the Backoffice Configuration, that prevented from persisting plugin-related information in the `meta` property of the configuration.

## How to update your Console

For on-premise installations, please contact your Mia-Platform referent and upgrade your _Console Helm Chart_ to `v9.5.5-hotfix.3`.
