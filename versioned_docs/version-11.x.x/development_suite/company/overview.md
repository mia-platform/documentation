A "Company" in Mia-Platform isn't merely a business entity in the traditional sense. It embodies a resource overseeing a collection of projects within the platform.  
Think of it as a container, encapsulating various initiatives, and providing a centralized control point. This design not only facilitates effective project management but significantly enhances governance over resources and operations.

In practical terms, a "Company" could encompass all projects of an organization or just a subset, perhaps representing the undertakings of a single operational unit or department within a larger business. Such flexibility enables organizations to structure and organize their projects to best mirror their operational setup and needs.
