### Leaving a Company

If you no longer want to be part of a Company, you can decide to leave it by clicking on the exit button placed at the end of each table row.

:::warning
You will be asked to confirm your choice. After leaving a Company, you will lose access to all its Projects and resources until you are reinstated as a member of the Company. In addition, leaving the Company will result in automatically leaving all Company groups of which you belong to.
