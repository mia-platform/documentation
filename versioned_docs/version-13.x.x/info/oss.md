It follows the copyright notice of the modules and libraries used in Mia-Platform.

Mia-Platform includes components subject to the terms and conditions of “open source” software licenses. To the extent applicable, we will identify open source software included in Mia-Platform. Some of these licenses require us to provide the open source software to you on the terms of the open source license instead of the terms of the Agreement. In that case, the terms of the open source license will apply, and you will have the rights granted in such licenses to the open source software itself, such as access to source code, right to make modifications, and right to reverse engineer. If you are using Mia-Platform in the form provided to you, in accordance with your permitted scope of use, with no distribution of software to third parties, then none of these open source licenses impose any obligations on you beyond what is stated in the Agreement.
