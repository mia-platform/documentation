Extensions allow expanding Console capabilities by adding custom pages to the sidebar navigation. This allows you to provide users with new pages tailored to your Company's needs or integrate external tools with a seamless experience within the product.

## Extension Manager

Extensions can be managed through a dedicated section called **Extensibility** placed in the Company Overview page.

:::info
Only **Company Owners** have the necessary permissions to see and use this section.
Moreover, extensions are **only accessible within the Company** they are registered into.

There are different extension types supported:

- iframe: allows you to embed web pages in Console using an `<iframe>` tag
- External link: these extensions will be shown as menu items in the sidebar but opened in a new window on click
- Composer page: allows you to compose a web page by means of a [`micro-lc`](https://micro-lc.io/) configuration

:::tip
Embedding a web app as an *iframe* extension may require additional configurations,
such as making sure `x-frame-options` header or the `frame-ancestors`Â Content Security Policy are properly configured
:::

## Add new Extension

You can add a new extension to your Company at any moment; creating an extension requires the following configurations to be set:

- **Extension name** (*required*): the name for your extension
- **Destination Area** (*required*): the area in Console where your extension menu item will be placed
- **Category** (*required*): the menu category that will contain the extension menu item

:::info
The available **Category** options depend on the selected **Destination Area**.
:::
- **Entry URL** (*required for iframe and External link extensions*): the URL of the web page that will be displayed when accessing your extension (This will be embedded inside an iframe or opened in a new window depending on the extension type)
- **Template**: A `micro-lc` configuration you might want to initialize your extension with. Available only for Composer page extensions.
- **Visibility**: You might want to make your extension visible on the whole Company, or maybe just on a few Projects. This field lets you set the contexts in which you want to make your extension visible. If nothing is checked, the extension will be inactive.

:::info
When the *Company Overview* destination area is selected, the only available **Visibility** option will be the *Whole Company*.

After creating the extension as shown in the example above, you can refresh the page and verify that the extension has been added to the sidebar and is accessible.

## Extensions Table

If there is at least one extension, you can view a table with all the existing extensions for the Company.

![extensions table](./img/extensions/extensions-table.png)

On this page, you can:

- [Add new extensions](#add-new-extension)
- [Access the detail page](#extension-detail) of an extension by clicking on its name
- Delete an extension

## Extension Detail

The extension detail page allows you to view the main information that characterizes the registered extension, which can also be modified through the corresponding *Edit* buttons.

![extension detail](./img/extensions/extension-detail.png)

### Extension Info

The *Extension Info* card contains the identifying information for the extension, where only the name and entry URL can be edited.

![edit extension info](./img/extensions/edit-extension-info.png)

### Extension Configuration

If the current extension is of type Composer page, the badge will display the *Edit page with MFE Composer* button which brings the user to a page where it can edit the extension's `micro-lc` configuration.

### Extension Location

The *Extension Location* card contains the information related to the positioning of the extension menu item within the Console; these details are fully editable.

![edit extension destination](./img/extensions/edit-extension-destination.png)

### Extension Visibility

The *Extension Visibility* card shows in which contexts the extension is active and visible.

![edit extension visibility](./img/extensions/edit-extension-visibility.png)

:::info
Just as during creation, Visibility is tied to the Destination Area set for the extension.
For example, if the Destination Area is set to *Company Overview*, the only available visibility option will be *Whole Company*.
