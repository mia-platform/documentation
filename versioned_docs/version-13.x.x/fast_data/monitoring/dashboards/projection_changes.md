To download the dashboard's json click <a download target="_blank" href="/docs_files_to_download/dashboards/projection-changes.json">**here**</a> and import it on your Grafana portal.

:::note
The Projection Changes dashboard relies heavily on the [MongoDB Query Exporter](https://github.com/raffis/mongodb-query-exporter) and its configuration. For more info check out the [MongoDB and Apache Kafka metrics](/fast_data/monitoring/overview.md#mongodb-and-apache-kafka-metrics) section.
