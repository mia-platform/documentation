resolves lookups from a given data schema onto a given source.

:::info
Beginning with version 6.9.0 of the [CRUD Service][crud-service], [writable views][writable-views] are available.

Views are virtual collections that encapsulate the results derived from aggregation pipelines. Their primary function revolves around presenting data obtained from one collection within the contextual framework of a main collection, which is referred to as the "source". Normally, views are read-only, but since version 6.9.0 of the CRUD Service, editing a view will automatically reflect changes to the original collection.

This new feature offers a the possibility to handle lookup fields in CRUD Service collection directly in the backend. Most Back-Kit components are compatible with writable views feature and thus need not the CRUD Lookup Client for correct handling of [lookup fields][lookup-in-views].
:::

## How to configure

To correctly configure the CRUD Lookup Client, properties `dataSchema` and `basePath` should be specified.

```json
{
  "tag": "bk-crud-lookup-client",
  "properties": {
    "basePath": "/v2",
    "dataSchema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "riderId": {
          "type": "string",
          "format": "lookup",
          "lookupOptions": {
            "lookupDataSource": "riders",
            "lookupFields": ["name", "surname"],
            "lookupValue": "_id"
          }
        },
        "_id": {"type": "string"},
        "__STATE__": {"type": "string"}
      }
    }
  },
}
```

`basePath` is targeted path for HTTP requests, while `dataSchema` provides information on the structure of the data in the CRUD collection, including [information on how to handle lookup fields][lookup-fields].

### Context

The CRUD Lookup Client is able to handle [dynamic configurations][dynamic-configurations] for the [lookupOptions][lookup-options] field of [data-schema] entries through [handlebars].

In particular, the following information are available for specifying dynamic values:
  - the information of the currently logged user, via `currentUser`
  - information about the pathname of the current URL, via `pathnameParams`.\
    `pathnameParams.params` includes the result of the match between the `urlMask` property and the [pathname][window-location] of the URL, while `pathnameParams.path` holds the full pathname. This requires property [urlMask][url-mask] to be defined.
  - information about the query parameters of the current URL, via `searchParams`.\
    `searchParams.params` includes the result of the match between the `urlMask` property and the [query][window-location] of the URL, while `searchParams.path` holds the full query as a string. This requires property [urlMask][url-mask] to be defined.

This is shown in an [example](#example-lookup-queries-with-info-from-url) below.

## Examples

### Example: basic usage

The CRUD Lookup Client provides support to resolve [lookup fields][lookup-fields].
The provided behavior is quite alike to SQL join resolution, but on a frontend client.

Let's say the data-schema looks like:

```json
{
  "$defs": {
    "city": {
      "type": "string",
      "lookupOptions": {
        "lookupDataSource": "cities",
        "lookupValue": "_id",
        "lookupFields": ["name"]
      }
    }
  },
  "dataSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "_id": "#/$defs/_id",
      "city": "#/$defs/city",
      "addresses": {
        "type": "array",
        "items": {
          "address1": "#/$defs/address1",
          "city": "#/$defs/city"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

hence `city` is a lookup from another collection called by both first and second level of
an item described by the previous data schema.

The CRUD Lookup Client will perform a recursive analysis on the data schema. Starting from a given data sample

```json
[
  {
    "_id": "1",
    "city": "city_1",
    "addresses": [
      {
        "address1": "12 Byron St.",
        "city": "city_124"
      },
      {
        "address1": "1 Batman Rd.",
        "city": "city_124"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

it will fetch a projection `lookupFields` of `lookupDataSource`

```
city_1 -> Sydney
city_124 -> Melbourne
```

and emit a [lookup-data] event with a resolved partial data structure as payload

```json
[
  {
    "city": "Sydney",
    "addresses": [
      {
        "city": "Melbourne"
      },
      {
        "city": "Melbourne"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

such structure can be compared with the original datum, which is not modified.

### Example: lookup queries with info from url

A CRUD Lookup Client configured like the following:

```json
{
  "tag": "bk-crud-lookup-client",
  "properties": {
    "urlMask:": "/restaurants/:id",
    "dataSchema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "cityId": {
          "type": "string",
          "format": "lookup",
          "lookupOptions": {
            "lookupDataSource": "cities",
            "lookupValue": "_id",
            "lookupFields": ["name"],
            "lookupQueries": [
             {
                "property": "_id",
                "operator": "equal",
                "value": "{{pathnameParams.params.id}}"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

assuming the current URL to be:
```
'/restaurants/restaurant-id-123'
```

then the options for field "cityId" are fetched with extra query:
```json
{
  "_id": {"$eq": "restaurant-id-123"}
}
```
