The Content Management System (CMS) has been deprecated and it has been substituted by [Microfrontend Composer](/microfrontend-composer/what-is.md).

Here you will find all the steps to update the CMS.

## 1. How to understand your version of the CMS

To understand the current version of your CMS, open the CMS page. Scroll down the **left side menu** to the end: at the end of all the collections, you will find the wording **"My API CMS v7.0.10]"** with the indication of the version (in this example v7.0.10).

In the [release notes](/release-notes/versions.md), you will find the eventual information about new CMS versions and features.

## 2. How to update the CMS version

To update the CMS version the steps are two:

### First step

Change the **CMS configuration**. The path to access the configuration file on git is:

`>projectname/Webapp/custom CMS/.gitlab-ci.yml`

In the "variables" section you can find **"CMS_VERSION"**, which must be updated with the latest available or desired version of the CMS. At this point, the CMS in test is saved and displayed.

### Second step

Proceed with the **configuration for Gitlab CI** . To do this the path on git is:

`>projectname/config/.gitlab-ci.yml`

In the file you can find the configuration of all environments (development, preprod and cloud).

For each environments, in the "variables" section you can update the CMS version to the **"CMS_IMAGE_NAME"** field.

:::warning
You should **save** and **deploy** the project from the API Console in each environments. Only after the deploy it will be possible to see the updated CMS version in each environments.
