## [1.3.2] - 2024-09-20

### Added

#### Targets

- `mongodb` target. Models will be stored on a dedicated collection with the following target configuration:
  ```json
  {
    // ...
    "target": {
      "type": "mongodb",
      "url": "mongodb://test:27017/?replicaSet=rs", // ðŸ‘ˆ mongodb connection string: the database must be a replica set
      "database": "test_database", // ðŸ‘ˆ if defined, it will be used as default database to store the models
    }
  }
  ```
  
  The record will be stored in a collection named `open-lineage-datasets`.
  
  > **NOTE:**
  >
  > To use MongoDB as a target, the database must be configured as a replica set.

### Updated

- Crud Service http connection now has an additional parameter, `healthcheck`, which contains the path used to retrieve the version of the service.

### Added

- `settings` field to connection configuration object;
- `options` optional field for _oracle_ odbc configurations: this field defines the tables that will be used for retrieve the metadata.

### Changed

- `version` field in the `oracle` odbc configuration has been moved outside of the `params` object, so it can be used along with odbc connection string.
  ```json title={example.json}
  { 
    "type": "odbc",
    "configuration": {
      "vendor": "oracle",
      "version": "11",
      "params": {/** ... */}
