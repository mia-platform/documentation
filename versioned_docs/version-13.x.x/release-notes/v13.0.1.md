## Console

### Clone configuration of a Sidecar

From the `Sidecars` section, you can now clone an existing configuration of a Sidecar to other Microservices. You can perform such action by simply clicking on the new "Add to another microservice" button available in the detail of each Sidecar and select the configuration you want to clone and the target Microservices in which to attach such Sidecar configuration. 

For more information, please refer to the [Sidecars documentation page](/console/design-your-projects/sidecars.md#clone-a-sidecar).

### Improvements

### Improved Console navigation with ctrl/cmd + k

The navigation with `ctrl/cmd + k` has been revised and improved for a better user experience when navigating among resources. Users can now easily see which Companies and Projects they belong to and can quickly search within these resources and seamlessly jump to them.

### Interpolation in Annotations and Labels for Marketplace items

When defining a new service on the Markeplace, it is now possible to configure the desired interpolations for Annotations and Labels in it, so that when the respective resource is created on a given Project on Console, the interpolated values are correctly set.

### Delete a Microservice in Advanced tab

The experience of deleting a Microservice has been revised: from now on, if you want to delete a Microservice, you need to do so within the `Advanced` tab in the Microservice detail page.

### Raw Manifest Configuration in Advanced tab

Configuring the raw manifest of a Microservice is now possible within the `Advanced` tab in the Microservice detail page.

### Git repository name validation accepts also dots

In the creation of a template or an example, you can now insert dots inside the Git Repository Name, as the validation now allows such inclusion.

### Human readable error validations in Create new branch modal & Project creation page

Error validations when trying to create a new Branch or a new Project appear now more human readable, improving clarity and user understanding.

### Enable Microservice metric gathering in a Monitoring tab

From now on, the Microservice monitoring can be managed in the `Monitoring` tab of each microservice.

### Generate CRUD collection fields from data sample

From the `Import fields` button, an option has been added that allows you to generate fields ** From a data sample**. 
Doing this will replace the current fields with those contained within the file.
The supported file extensions are: `.csv` and `.json`.

* When a Javascript custom cast function returns a Javascript Date object, now the service properly maps the type into the internal one
