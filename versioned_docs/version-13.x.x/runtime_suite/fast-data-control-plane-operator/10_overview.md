_Fast Data Control Plane Operator_ is a service of the [Fast Data Runtime Management](/fast_data/runtime_management/overview.mdx) setup which allows you to observe and change the status of your Fast Data services in a specific namespace.

To configure the service properly check out the [service configuration](/fast_data/runtime_management/control_plane_operator.mdx) page. Mind that the service won't work on its own and needs the rest of the Runtime Management pieces to do its job.
