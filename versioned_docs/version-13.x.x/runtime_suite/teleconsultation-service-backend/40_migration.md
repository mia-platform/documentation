## Migration to v2.0.0

Update the [**BANDYER_BASE_URL**][environment-variables] environment variable with the new API base URL:

- Sandbox environment: `https://api.sandbox.eu.bandyer.com`
- Production environment: `https://api.[region].bandyer.com`

If you are using Kaleyra in Europe, the value of the `region` parameter should be `eu`.

You can also find the base URL to use among the details of your API key and SID, just follow the instructions provided in the [official Kaleyra documentation][kaleyra-api-key].

For additional information about environments, please check [official Kaleyra documentation][kaleyra-environments].
