The Device Manager needs some configuration in order to be used effectively.

## CRUD collections

To use the Device Manager you need to create the following CRUD collections:

- `devices`: a CRUD collection containing all past and present enrolled devices;
- `health data type`: a CRUD containing the health data type and their schema;
- `health data`: a CRUD containing the health records;

### Devices

This CRUD collection stores all the past and currently enrolled devices, including basic product details, and tracks the patient assigned to each device.

:::tip

You can create the CRUD by importing <a download target="_blank" href="/docs_files_to_download/device-manager/crud_devices.json">this JSON schema</a>.
Remember to set the `CRUD_DEVICES_ENDPOINT` environment variable with the CRUD internal endpoint.

### Health Data

This CRUD collection, for each health data received from a device, the raw content and metadata (type, format, etc.) and the normalized version.

:::tip

You can create the CRUD by importing <a download target="_blank" href="/docs_files_to_download/device-manager/crud_health_data.json">this JSON schema</a>.
Remember to set the `CRUD_HEALTH_DATA_ENDPOINT` environment variable with the CRUD internal endpoint.

### Health Data Types

This CRUD collection contains all the health data type specifications, including the supported data types (both raw and normalized) and normalization rules (for raw only).

Remember to set the `CRUD_HEALTH_DATA_TYPE_ENDPOINT` environment variable with the CRUD internal endpoint.

:::warning

The service currently expects the `normalizedDataSchema` to be as follows, otherwise some features like chart visualization may not work as expected:

```json
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "period": {
        "type": "object"
        },
        "observations": {
        "type": "array",
        "items": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
            "code": {
                "type": "string"
            },
            "name": {
                "type": "string"
            },
            "unit": {
                "type": "string"
            },
            "value": {
                "type": "number"
            }
            }
        }
        }
    },
    "required": [
        "observations",
        "period"
    ]
}
```

If you use a different schema the following endpoints may not work as intended:

-   [`GET /prototypes`][get-prototypes]
-   [`GET /chart-data`][get-chart-data]
