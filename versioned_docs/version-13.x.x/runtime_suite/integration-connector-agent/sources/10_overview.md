Sources are the external systems from which the Integration Connector Agent retrieves data.

The supported sources are:

- [**Console**](/runtime_suite/integration-connector-agent/sources/15_console.md): The Console source allows you to monitor changes in Mia-Platform Console and perform actions in response.
- [**Jira**](/runtime_suite/integration-connector-agent/sources/20_jira.md): The Jira source allows you to monitor changes in Jira entities.
