Sinks are the destinations where the Integration Connector Agent sends the processed data.
They are responsible for storing or further processing the data received from the external sources.
The Integration Connector Agent supports multiple types of sinks, allowing for flexible and scalable data integration solutions.

The supported sinks are:

- [**MongoDB**](/runtime_suite/integration-connector-agent/sinks/20_mongodb.md): A NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format.
