In order to upgrade Mia-Platform Console, all you need to do is to update the `mia-console` Chart version dependency in your `Chart.yaml`Â file.

:::tip
When upgrading Mia-Platform Console to a new major release, always remember that updates must be performed one major at a time. Therefore, in order to upgrade from v11 to v13 you must first upgrade to the latest v12 version.

To find out how to upgrade your installation to the latest version of v12, visit the [following documentation](/docs/12.x/infrastructure/self-hosted/installation-chart/how-to-upgrade).
:::

```yaml title="Chart.yaml" {9} showLineNumbers
apiVersion: v2
name: console
version: "0.0.0"
kubeVersion: ">= 1.20.0"
description: Self Hosted Console Installation Chart
type: application
dependencies:
  - name: mia-console
    version: "X.Y.Z"
    repository: "https://nexus.mia-platform.eu/repository/helm-internal/"
```

When upgrading also make sure to check if any new configuration option is available or if something has been removed.

:::info
The Chart version follows [semver](https://semver.org/) policy so any breaking change with the Chart will always be followed by a Major release. Minor releases may include new configuration options while as a general rule of thumb, patches never holds new configuration options but only internal updates and fixes.

## Console v13 - version upgrades

### Upgrade from v13.7.0 to v13.7.1

With Console v13.7.1, the Mia-Assistant can be configured to use any of the supported LLM/Embedding models.

You can choose between:

- azure
- openai
- vertex

Follow the [Assistant documentation](./helm-values/75_assistant.md#llm-and-embeddings-model-configuration) to learn more about how to configure it.

### Upgrade from v13.6.2 to v13.7.0

With Console v13.7.0, the new Audit Logs feature is available. A new **required value** has been added to the configuration that lets you configure the audit storage.

See the [Audit Section](./helm-values/20_general-settings.md#audit-logs-configuration) in the General settings page to find out how to configure it.

:::tip
As a best practice it is advised to store Audit logs in a different Database than application data. The `configurations.audit.mongodbUrl` allows you to configure a different connection string for this purpose.
