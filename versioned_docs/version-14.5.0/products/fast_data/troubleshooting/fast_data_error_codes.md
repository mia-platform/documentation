In this page are collected all the codes associated to errors that may be generated by Fast Data core components.  
Each error code is grouped under a specific category to help understanding which component operation may have raised the error.
Moreover, for each of them is provided a brief explanation of what caused it and which are the steps that should be taken
to potentially resolve the encountered issue.

Under standard conditions, this is not a problem since service retries autonomously failed operation. However, in case the service does not make any progress or it restarts indefinitely it may be possible that storage component is experiencing an issue in writing projections. We recommend to verify that for each projection all the needed indexes were created on the external storage system. When using MongoDB as storage, we advised to deploy the [CRUD Service](/runtime-components/plugins/crud-service/10_overview_and_usage.md) plugin alongside Fast Data application, which ensures necessary indexes are created on the database. |
