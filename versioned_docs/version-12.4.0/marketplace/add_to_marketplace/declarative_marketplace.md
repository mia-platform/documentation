title: Manage your Marketplace Items with a Declarative Approach
sidebar_label: Marketplace Declarative Approach
---

In addition to the basic use of the tool through individual application commands, such as list, get, and resource deletion, a *declarative* approach is recommended. This approach is based on the use of [miactl](/cli/miactl/10_overview.md) in combination with a [Git Provider and a CI/CD system](/console/company-configuration/providers/overview.md).

This usage allows for centralized management of your Marketplace, enabling supervised control of the state of your resources. It also extends the possibility of contribution to users without the necessary permissions (e.g., the use of Pull Requests/Merge Requests supervised by a maintainer).

## Setup a Custom Declarative Journey

Here we explain how you can implement a Custom Declarative Journey.

### Requirements

1. Git Provider
2. CI/CD Tool
3. a [Service Account](/development_suite/identity-and-access-management/manage-service-accounts.md)

### Creation of the repository

Imagine you already have some Marketplace items and their related file manifests, ready to be deployed to the Console.

Create a repository on your Git Provider, and add the item files following this structure:

```

```

The item names are purely indicative, this example is only to explain a potential use-case.

The JSON and YAML files above follow the structure explained [in the related documentation](/marketplace/add_to_marketplace/manage_marketplace_items.md).

Here is an example of the Inventory System plugin config file:

```json
{
    "name" : "Inventory System",
    "itemId" : "inventory-system",
    "description" : "The Inventory System takes charge of a perfect inventory organization.",
    "type" : "plugin",
    "categoryId": "extracategory",
    "image" : {
        "localPath": "../../../images/inventory_system.png"
    },
    "supportedByImage" : {
        "localPath": "../../../images/acme_company.png"
    },
    "categoryId" : "inventory",
    "documentation" : {
        "type" : "externalLink",
        "url" : "https://example.com/docs/inventory-system"
    },
    "repositoryUrl" : "https://gitlab.example.org/inventory-system",
    "resources" : {
        "services" : {
            "inventory-system" : {
                "type" : "plugin",
                "name" : "inventory-system",
                "dockerImage" : "example.org/inventory-system:1.0.0",
                "componentId" : "inventory-system",
                "defaultDocumentationPath" : "/documentation/json",
                "containerPorts" : [
                    {
                        "name" : "http",
                        "from" : 80,
                        "to" : 3000,
                        "protocol" : "TCP"
                    }
                ],
                "defaultLogParser": "mia-json"
            }
        }
    },
    "tenantId" : "acme-company"
}
```

You can similarly configure all the items you need.

### CI/CD Pipeline - An example with Gitlab

You can use any CI/CD Tool; in this example, we provide you an example of Gitlab pipeline.

#### Setup the environment

First of all, you need to create a Service Account on the Console. In this example, we use a [Client Secret Basic authentication](/development_suite/identity-and-access-management/manage-service-accounts.md#adding-a-service-account). 

Create a `CLIENT_ID` and a `CLIENT_SECRET` [Gitlab CI/CD Variable](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/) in your project and set the respective `client-id` and `client-secret` values you obtained during the setup of the service account.

:::tip

We suggest to mask the variable and to protect it, as suggested in [Gitlab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#cicd-variable-security).

:::

#### Setup the pipeline file

Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file with the following contents:

```yaml
stages:
  - preparation
  - apply-marketplace

variables:
  # make sure to use the latest miactl version available https://github.com/mia-platform/miactl/releases
  MIACTL_VERSION: "0.8.0"  

preparation:
  stage: preparation
  image: alpine:latest
  script:
    - apk add --no-cache git
    - git clone $CI_REPOSITORY_URL ./my-repo
    - cd ./my-repo

apply-marketplace:
  stage: apply-marketplace
  image: ghcr.io/mia-platform/miactl:$MIACTL_VERSION
  script:
    - 'echo "COMPANY_ID: $COMPANY_ID"'
    - 'echo "CONSOLE_ENDPOINT: $CONSOLE_ENDPOINT"'
    - miactl context auth new-auth --client-id $CLIENT_ID --client-secret $CLIENT_SECRET
    - miactl context set new-context --company-id $COMPANY_ID --endpoint $CONSOLE_ENDPOINT --auth-name new-auth
    - miactl context use new-context
    - miactl marketplace apply -f ./resources

  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
```

:::caution

This pipeline is just an example. You may need to implement additional checks and use different images.

:::

Here is an explanation of the environment variables needed in the pipeline:

- `MIACTL_VERSION`: the version of miactl, make sure to always use the latest version in order to benefit the latest features and bug fixes.
- `CLIENT_ID`: a secret env containing the Service Account Client ID.
- `CLIENT_SECRET`: a secret env containing the Service Account Client Secret.
- `CONSOLE_ENDPOINT`: the base url of your Console installation.
- `COMPANY_ID`: the Company ID where you want the Marketplace Items to be created in.

## An example of interaction with the repository

Acme Corporation uses the Console as its Internal Development Platform.

Developers of the Company can open Merge Requests to the Marketplace Git repository created above, and Maintainers can approve and merge the MRs.

Imagine that a developer of Acme Corporation creates the Inventory System plugin, as in the example above.
They now want to add this plugin to their company. 

### The Merge Request process

In order to do so, they can open a Merge Request to the Gitlab Repository created above: 

![Declarative-CJ-Merge-Request](img/declarative_mr.png)

Once the MR is merged, the pipeline start applying the items in the repository; among them we can see that the Inventory System has been inserted successfully:

![Declarative-CJ-Pipeline-Log](img/declarative_pipeline_log.png)


Let's now assume that a developer spots a mistake in the plugin description. Similarly, they can open a Merge Request that addresses the error:

![Declarative-CJ-fix-MR](img/declarative_fix_mr.png)

After a maintainer merges the changes, a new pipeline is triggered, leading to an update of the item.

![Declarative-CJ-fix-Pipeline-Log](img/declarative_fix_pipeline_log.png)

### Verify the item on the Marketplace

From now on, the Marketplace item will be available in the Console:

![Inventory-System](img/inventory_system.png)

Console users can create and add this plugin to their Console projects.

### Item Deletion

Imagine now that for some reason you want to delete the item.

First of all, the item needs to be deleted from the repository.
A developer can open an MR to do so.

![Declarative-CJ-MR-Delete](img/declarative_delete_mr.png)

After merging this Merge Request, the pipeline won't delete the item from the Marketplace: a user with the needed permission needs to do so by using `miactl`.

First of all, list the marketplace items:

```bash
miactl markteplace list
```

A list of items is returned:
```
  ID                        ITEM ID                          NAME                            TYPE         
  ...
  654e32c6f6c6406e4f470b1e  inventory-system                 Inventory System                plugin       
  ...
```
Copy the ID of the Inventory System, and run the following command:

```bash
miactl marketplace delete 654e32c6f6c6406e4f470b1e
```

This will delete the item from the Marketplace, and the associated images.
