Welcome to the Mia-Platform Auth Architecture tutorial! This is an holistic guide on the crucial realm of both authentication and authorization, exploring all the possible architectures you could implement with Mia-Platform.

You will start with the basics, addressing the simplest scenarios first, and gradually advance, integrating external Identity Providers and tackling multi-project architectures.

For each of the following scenarios, we will provide both an overview of the architecture and a complete step-by-step tutorial to implement it.

### Scenarios

These are the scenarios you can find in this tutorial:
- [Scenario 1: Use static API Keys](/console/tutorials/configure-marketplace-components/auth-architecture/static-api-key.md)
- [Scenario 2: Integrate an external Identity Provider](/console/tutorials/configure-marketplace-components/auth-architecture/external-idp.md)
- [Scenario 3: Integrate an external Identity Provider but manage session and user groups within your project](/console/tutorials/configure-marketplace-components/auth-architecture/external-idp-internal-session.md)
- [Scenario 4: Centralize the authentication in a multi-projects architecture](/console/tutorials/configure-marketplace-components/auth-architecture/multiple-projects.mdx)
