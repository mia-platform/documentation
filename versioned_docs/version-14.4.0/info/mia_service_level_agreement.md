## Definitions

- **Service** refers to the PaaS hosting service regulated by the relative Agreement between Customer and Supplier, which includes the provision of the Infrastructure and its monitoring, maintenance and assistance;

- **Monthly Service Time** is the monthly time in which the Service is required to be available. It is calculated monthly as defined in the Subscription Form or in the absence of a definition by multiplying the days of the month by the 24 hours of the day;

- **Monthly Service Unavailability (Downtime)**: the Service is unavailable when all users are unable to access (using more than one network connection) the Product and/or a functionality of the Product and/or Add-on Components, due to infrastructural problems. Excluded from these problems are those of an application nature, including but not limited to: bugs in the code of the Product or Add-on Components;

- **Monthly Service Availability (Uptime)** is the availability of the Service. It is calculated monthly by subtracting from the Monthly Service Time the sum of all the minutes of unavailability of the Service in the month. 

- **Scheduled Maintenance** is the Downtime Period related to network, hardware, or software maintenance or upgrades. With respect to the list of Services detailed in the table, we will perform scheduled maintenance at our discretion or during a user-configurable maintenance window.

## SLA Exclusions

1. That results from a suspension of the Mia-Platform PaaS Hosting Services license due to unauthorized or irregular use.

2. That results from a suspension of the Mia-Platform PaaS Hosting Services license due to payments delay.

3. Due to suspensions, interruptions, delays, problems caused by force majeure problems, and so by events not attributable, neither indirectly, to Mia-Platform (for example: bugs, anomalies, interruption or delay in telecommunications, acts of any a governmental body, war)
