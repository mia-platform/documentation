### The Scenario

An international corporation has a hybrid cloud strategy. Their production workloads are split between a managed Kubernetes service on AWS (EKS) for scalability and an on-premise Kubernetes cluster for data-sensitive applications. The CloudOps team struggles to manage these two distinct environments.

### The Challenge

* **Tool Sprawl**: The team uses different sets of tools and scripts to deploy and monitor applications on EKS versus the on-premise cluster, leading to duplicated effort and increased complexity.
* **Inconsistent Configurations**: Applications deployed on-premise often have slightly different configurations than those on EKS (e.g., for networking or storage), leading to "it works on my cloud" problems and making it difficult to move workloads between environments.
* **Lack of Unified Visibility**: To check the health of the entire system, operators have to switch between different dashboards and terminals (AWS Console, Lens, custom scripts), making it impossible to get a holistic, real-time view.
* **Complex Access Management**: Managing user access and permissions for two separate environments is cumbersome and error-prone, increasing the security risk.

### The Solution with Mia-Platform

The CloudOps team adopts **Mia-Platform Console** as a centralized control plane to manage both their AWS and on-premise clusters.

1.  **Connecting All Clusters to the Console**: From the **Clusters** section at the Company level, the team connects both the EKS and the on-premise Kubernetes clusters. They provide the necessary credentials (like service account tokens) for each cluster, and the Console establishes a secure connection. Now, both clusters are visible and manageable from a single interface.

2.  **Standardizing Environments Across Clusters**: In the **Project Blueprint**, they define the company's standard environments (e.g., `Development`, `Staging`, `Production`). They then map these logical environments to the physical clusters:
    * `Development` and `Staging` environments are configured to deploy on a specific namespace in the on-premise cluster.
    * The `Production` environment is configured to deploy on the EKS cluster in AWS.

3.  **Unified Deployment Process**: The development teams now use a single, consistent process to deploy their applications, regardless of the target cluster. When they trigger a deploy from the Console to the `Production` environment, the pipeline automatically uses the correct credentials and context for the EKS cluster. When they deploy to `Development`, the same pipeline targets the on-premise cluster. This eliminates configuration drift.

4.  **Centralized Monitoring and Observability**: The Ops team uses the **Runtime Area** in the Console to monitor both environments. They can switch between the `Production` (EKS) and `Development` (on-premise) environments with a single click, viewing pod status, streaming logs, and checking resource usage in a unified way. They also embed their Grafana dashboards, which collect metrics from both clusters, directly into the Console's **Dashboard** section.

### The Outcome

* **Single Pane of Glass**: The CloudOps team now manages their entire hybrid infrastructure from one place. They have a unified view of all their clusters, namespaces, and applications, drastically reducing operational complexity.
* **Consistent and Portable Workloads**: Since deployments are standardized, applications can be moved between the on-premise and cloud environments with minimal changes, providing true workload portability.
* **Improved Troubleshooting Speed**: When an issue arises, the team doesn't waste time figuring out which tool to use. They go directly to the Console's Runtime Area, select the environment, and start debugging immediately, whether the problem is in the cloud or on-premise.
* **Simplified Governance**: Access control is managed centrally through the Console's IAM, ensuring that user permissions are applied consistently across all connected clusters. Automated policies and controls guarantee security and compliance best practices by design.

Mia-Platform Console has provided the organization with a powerful abstraction layer over their hybrid infrastructure, enabling teams to take full advantage of multi-cloud without the associated operational overhead.
