The project creation process allows you to configure a project, which lifecycle can then be entirely managed and developed through Console areas.

## How to set up Console

The first section of this guide allows you to gain the prerequisites needed to create a project.
In particular, to create a project, you need to have already set up your Console and configured these three features:

* **Provider**: This will be used by the Console to correctly retrieve the third party service providers needed by your projects;
* **Company**: This is the upper level of projects. Each created project shares the same information (environments, CI/CD integration and cluster information) of its company;
* **Template**: Repository with libraries and pre-filled configurations. Each company could have one or more template. By starting a project from an existing template, you can pre-fill active services in your project and start all the similar projects with the same configuration. For example, the template can define the pipelines and the usage (or not usage) of CMS in your project. To see an example of Jenkins pipelines definition, take a look at [this](/development_suite/deploy/configuration.md#how-to-automatically-create-jenkins-job-on-project-creation) page of our doc.

If you have already configured these features, you can directly [skip to the last section](#project-creation).

## CRUDs

You can find more info about how to create a CRUD visiting the [CRUD documentation](../api-console/api-design/crud_advanced.md).

### Create a Provider

If you already have the provider you need in your CRUD, you can [skip this section](#create-a-company).

You can create a Git provider by setting up a specific document following the procedure described [here](configure-provider.mdx). This document will be used by services to correctly retrieve the information about the provider that you use for your projects.
The fields necessary for this collection are:

* `providerId` (*required*): the human-readable ID of the provider (e.g. "my-git-provider" or "my-pipeline-provider");
* `type` (*required*): the name of the provider. The currently supported providers are `gitlab`, `github`, `azure-devops`, and `bitbucket`;
* `baseUrl` (*required*): the provider base URL used to persist configurations;
* `apiBaseUrl` (*required*): the provider base URL used by core service to call the provider (e.g. gitlab.com/api or api.github.com/).

### Create a Company

If you already have a company, you can [skip this section](#create-a-template).

You can create a company by setting up a specific document through the appropriate CMS section. The company is the upper level of projects. It allows to create a project configured inside an already existing infrastructure, whose information are the same for all projects within the company: *environments*, *cluster information*, *CI/CD integration*.

:::info
The information related to the company cannot be changed during the project creation steps (if not specified otherwise).
:::

The fields necessary for this collection are:

* `name` (*required*): the name of the company;

* `description`: the description of the company;

* `tenantId` (*required*): the human-readable ID of the company (e.g. "mia-platform"). It must adhere to this regex: `(^[a-z]+[a-z0-9-]*$)`;

* `defaultTemplateId`: the default template to be used in the project creation. This information can be changed in the project creation wizard steps;

* `cmsImageName`: CMS Docker image to interpolate in template archive. It should also contain the CMS tag to use (if `cms-site` service is disabled in the project creation, it will not be used);

* `repository` (*required*): object which specifies the information about the repository where the projects of this company have to be created. The object must have the following properties:
  * **providerId** (*required*): `providerId` existing into the provider's CRUD. It is used to get information about the provider to use. This ID is important because it affects many requests used by the developer Console;
  * **basePath**: base path where the project will be created. The user needs to have permission for creating projects on this path;
  * **visibility**: visibility of the project.

:::info
Here some tips on how to correctly configure the `basePath` property, grouped by Git provider:

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="gitlab" label="GitLab" default>

The `basePath` is the basePath of the group where to create the project. 

If the group does not exist, it will be created only if the user has the needed permission to create the group in its parent.

E.g.

* /groupA/groupB -> if groupB does not exist AND user have permission to create groups in groupA, then groupB will be created;
* /groupA/groupB -> if groupB does not exist AND user have no permission to create groups in A, then groupB will NOT be created;
* /groupA/groupB -> if groupB does not exist AND groupA does not exist, then it will NOT be created any group.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="github" label="GitHub">

The `basePath` have to be an existing organization. If it does not exist, it will not be created.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="azure-devops" label="Azure DevOps">

The `basePath` is the path where your Azure project is reachable: the pattern is `company-name/project-name`.

For example, if you project is reachable at the URL `https://dev.azure.com/mia-platform-devops/Test`, then the `basePath` must be `mia-platform-devops/Test`.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="bitbucket" label="BitBucket">

The `basePath` is the path where your BitBucket project is reachable: the pattern is `projects/project-code`.

For example, if you project is reachable at the URL `https://bitbucket.mia-platform.eu/projects/TSDB`, then the `basePath` must be `projects/TSDB`.
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::

* `environments` (*required*): an array of objects containing the definitions of the environments for the company. The content of this arrays will be interpolated to replace `%projectId%` by inserting the `projectId` field in the project creation. Each object should contain, for example:

    ```js
      {
        "label": "Development",
        "envId": "development",
        "envPrefix": "development",
        "hosts": [
          {
            "host": "%projectId%.test.mia-platform.eu",
            "scheme": "https"
          },
          {
            "host": "cms.%projectId%.test.mia-platform.eu",
            "isBackoffice": true
          }
        ],
        "cluster": {
          "clusterId": "human-readable-id-of-the-cluster",
          "hostname": "127.0.0.1", // hostname of the cluster
          "namespace": "%projectId%-development",
          "kubeContextVariables": {
            "KUBE_URL": "KUBE_DEV_URL",
            "KUBE_TOKEN": "KUBE_DEV_TOKEN"
          }
        }
      }
    ```

  :::caution
  The terms _tenant_ and _tenantId_ refer to the actual company new terms. The _tenant_ term is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
  :::
  :::warning
  Do not set in the `cluster.kubeContextVariables` object the plain values to access the cluster. Write the variable key name for the specified environment (as shown in the example). The values saved here are not encrypted!
  :::

* `pipelines` (*required*): the CI/CD pipelines used by the company, for example:

    ```json
      {
        "type": "gitlab-ci"
      }
    ```

* `environmentVariables`: an object which describes the configuration to enable the Variables section in the Project Settings area of the Console. The only supported type is `gitlab`.

  There are three ways to configure a project:

  1. **empty**: it is not set as default in the project creation, but should be configured manually after the process;

  2. **only type configuration**, for example:

      ```json
        {
          "type": "gitlab"
        }
      ```

      The project reads the variables from the first parent group of the Configurations project in GitLab.

      As an example, with a GitLab project to be saved in `/clients/mia-platform/configurations`, the environment variables are written in the `clients/mia-platform` group;

  3. **complete configuration**, for example:

      ```json
        {
          "type": "gitlab",
          "baseUrl": "https://my-gitlab-host",
          "storage": {
            "type": "projects",
            "path": "clients/mia-platform/configurations"
          }
        }
      ```

      This configuration is saved only within the company, and should be retrieved at runtime in project fetching from company info. So if your company has all environment variables of the projects set in the parent group, this setting might be changed for all projects at the same time.

* `logicalScopeLayers`: an array of objects identifying the set of logical layers available in the current company. Each object is shaped as follows:
  * **name**: identifies the name of the logical layer;
  * **order**: identifies the numerical order of the layer, in order to display it according to the sorting defined by the user.
  When a project is merged with its company information, the `logicalScopeLayers` will be created in the project model according to its `layerId` value. Please refer to the section [How to create a project on Console] for further details.

* `availableNamespaces`: namespaces internally accessible from your project, using the `cross-projects` endpoint. It is useful when your company is made up of several projects that communicate with each other. The content of this array will be interpolated to replace `%projectId%` with the `projectId` field in the project creation;

* `dockerImageNameSuggestion`: object which defines the Docker image name suggestion that will be passed to every project created in your company. This suggestion will appear in the `Docker Image Name` field when you [create a microservice](../api-console/api-design/services#how-to-create-a-microservice-from-an-example-or-from-a-template).
The object should have the following properties:

  * **type** (*required*): string which defines the type of suggestion. Currently, there exist three types:

    * `PROJECT_ID` (*default*): the suggestion for the Docker image name will be in the following format: `<project-id>/<your-service-name>`. This is the default behavior, even without setting this property the suggestion will follow this format. You must **not** set the `prefix` property if you have chosen this type;
    * `REPOSITORY`: the suggestion for the Docker image name will be in the following format: `<your-group-name>/<your-repo-name>`. You must **not** set the `prefix` property if you have chosen this type;
    * `CONSTANT_PREFIX`: the suggestion for the Docker image name will be in the following format: `<prefix-value>/<your-service-name>`. The `prefix` property is required for this type and will replace `prefix-value`.

  * **prefix**: string that defines the prefix that will appear in the suggestion for the Docker image name. This property must be defined only when **type** property value is set to `CONSTANT_PREFIX`.

:::info
`<your-service-name>`, `<your-group-name>`, `<your-repo-name>`, are field values that you will decide during the [creation of a microservice](../api-console/api-design/services#how-to-create-a-microservice-from-an-example-or-from-a-template). Some of these values must be defined in order to receive a suggestion for the Docker image name (depending on the suggestion **type**).
:::

* `enabledSecurityFeatures`: a set of features to enforce the security of the project. For further details, take a look at [the last section](#configure-security-features) of this page.

#### Add the first Company User

After your company has been created you have to add the first user to it, who may be yourself or another user in the Platform. Regardless, head over to the CMS page and choose the *Bindings* menu item (only a restricted set of users have access to this section, ask your Console Administrator if you need access to it).

In the *Bindings* section, select the *Create new* button and fill in the form, type a custom *Binding ID* (make sure it is unique in the whole collection, something like `{tenantId}-{desiredRole}` should be enough), select the proper Role (generally at this point you'll be adding the first *Company Owner*) and make sure to select the correct user as Subject. Finally you'll have to assign the correct resource by filling it with an object as follows:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "company",
  "resourceId": "THE ID YOU PROVIDED UPON CREATION AS tenantId"
}
```

### Create a Template

If you already have a template, you can [skip this section](#how-to-create-a-project-archive).

A template is a repository which contains some project specific information.
Once you choose a company, you can choose a template.
The template allows you to pre-fill active services in your project and start all the similar projects with the same configuration.
In short, it constitutes a base on which to create your project.

:::info
The fields set by the template can be changed in the project creation.
:::

There are two ways to add services to a template:

* Using an `api-console-config`, which specifies the services that will be included in the projects created with that template, together with other details (e.g. environment variables). This requires you to add an `api-console-config.json` file in the root directory of the project;
* Using `enabledServices`, which only specifies whether a certain service is enabled or not, without the possibility to define any other detail.

:::caution
The `enabledServices` can only be used for core services (i.e. `cms-site`, `cms-backend`, `v1-adapter`, `export-service`, `auth0-client`, and `oauth-login-site`), while it does not work for services used from the Console that have been migrated to custom services (migrated services are now plugins, you can find them in the [marketplace](../../marketplace/overview_marketplace.md)). The only exception to this rule is that if your template uses `api-console-config` version 0.39 or lower, or do not use it at all, `enabledServices` will work for migrated services as well.
:::

The base structure of the `api-console-config.json` is the following:

```json
{
  "endpoints": {...},
  "decorators": {...},
  "services": {...},
  "configmaps": {...},
  "version": "...",
  "platformVersion": "..."
}
```

If you create the new `api-console-config.json` from an existing one, please remember to delete all fields that do not match the structure above, since they will be automatically generated by the Console after save and deploy actions (one of those, depending on the field).

You can create a Git provider by setting up a specific document through the appropriate CMS section.
The fields necessary for this collection are:

* `name` (*required*): the name of the template;

* `templateId` (*required*): the human-readable ID of the template (e.g. "mia-platform-multitenant-template"). It must adhere to this regex: `(^[a-z]+[a-z0-9-]*$)`;

* `description`: the description of the template;

* `archiveUrl`: URL to a gzip of the base project configuration folder. All contents of this folder will be copied into the target configuration, correctly interpolated. If you want to create a custom template, click [here](#how-to-create-a-project-archive) to see how to do it;

* `monitoring`: object which describes the monitoring tools supported by the project. For example:

  ```json
  {
    "systems": [
      {
        "type": "prometheus-operator"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  * **type**: so far, only one type of monitoring system is supported: `prometheus-operator`.
  In case `type` is set to `prometheus-operator`, you will be able to configure the creation of the `service monitor` for your microservices. More information about this feature [here](../api-console/api-design/microservice-monitoring.md).

* `deploy`: object which identifies some deploy related configurations. For example:

  ```json
    {
      "runnerTool": "mlp",
      "projectStructure": "default",
      "useMiaPrefixEnvs": false
    }
  ```

  * **runnerTool**: Set it to `mlp` if the project uses it as command line deployment tool. It is required to have the [Smart Deploy](../deploy/deploy.md#smart-deploy) feature enabled;
  * **useMiaPrefixEnvs**: Set it to **false** if you want the [Public Variables](../api-console/api-design/public_variables.md) to be saved without `MIA_` prefix. That depends on the command line deployment tool. If the project uses `mlp` you don't need to use the `MIA_` prefix;
  * **projectStructure**: Set it to `kustomize` if you want to use Kustomize to manage your microservices configurations. More info in [this section](./kustomize.md), otherwise use `default` or leave it blank to keep the usual configuration setup.

:::caution
If you set `projectStructure` to `kustomize`, your project configuration structure needs to be changed accordingly.
:::

:::note
If you switch `useMiaPrefixEnvs` from `true` to `false`, you have to remove the `MIA_` prefix by hand. This operation is not performed automatically by the Console.
:::

* `enabledServices`: object which contains as key the service handled by the Console and as value a boolean. If the value is true, the service is enabled and the Console will generate the configuration for that service, otherwise it will be skipped by the Console. For example:

    ```json
      {
        "api-gateway": true,
        "microservice-gateway": true,
        "crud-service": true,
        "session-manager": false,
        "auth-service": false,
        "cms-site": true,
        "cms-backend": true,
        "v1-adapter": true,
        "export-service": true,
        "swagger-aggregator": true,
        "login-site": false,
        "api-portal": true,
        "auth0-client": true,
        "authorization-service": true,
        "oauth-login-site": true
      }
    ```

* `staticSecret`: some templates could use the same static secret for a set of projects (especially used with architecture with multiple `api-gateway` entry points). Keys are optional. This is an example of object:

  ```json
    {
      "secret": "my-secret",
      "clientType":"cms"
    }
  ```

## How to create a Project Archive

The project archive is interpolated using [mustache.js](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js) as template system, using `%` as tag symbol instead of the default `{{` or `}}`.

:::note
In order to use the `%` character inside your project archive you can escape it by prefixing the character with an additional `%`. For example, the string `%%something` will be rendered as `%something` when the project archive will be interpolated.
:::

*mustache.js* is a web template system, which allows you to generate custom templates by replacing all the general information in the web template with your product or organization information.

You could create a project template to avoid copy/paste in every new project having the same base configuration.

At Mia-Platform, for example, we create a template to configure a project to use Auth0, Headless CMS, API Portal, and Traefik configuration. Therefore, for a company that uses this template, creating this type of project will be a very simple process.

You can interpolate the template with some project data. With *mustache.js*, you could iterate through an array, in order to have some configuration iterated for every environment.
The values you can use during template interpolation are:

For the project (accessible using `project.${field}`):

* `projectId`;
* `name`;
* `configurationGitPath`;
* `environments`.

Inside environments, you can access to:

* `envId`;
* `envPrefix`;
* `cluster` (an object containing `namespace` and `clusterId` string, `kubeContextVariables` object). Here you can find the variable names for the specified environment where to set the cluster variable;
* `hosts` (an array of objects, with `host` and `isBackoffice` fields).

:::warning
Do not set in the `cluster.kubeContextVariables` object the value to access the cluster. Write the variable key name for the specified environment (as shown in the example). The values saved here are not encrypted!
:::

An example of template for the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

```yml
include:
  # job template
  - project: 'platform/pipelines-templates'
    file: '/deploy/deploy-job.yml'
    ref: 'master'

%#tenant.cmsImageName%
variables:
  MIA_CMS_IMAGE_NAME: "%company.cmsImageName%"
%/company.cmsImageName%
%#project.environments%

%envId%:
  stage: release
  extends: .deploy_job

  variables:
    KUBE_URL: "\${cluster.kubeContextVariables.KUBE_URL}"
    KUBE_TOKEN: "\${cluster.kubeContextVariables.KUBE_TOKEN}"
    KUBE_CA_PEM: "\${cluster.kubeContextVariables.KUBE_CA_PEM}"
    ENVIRONMENT_PREFIX: "%envPrefix%_"

  only:
    variables:
      - $ENVIRONMENT_TO_DEPLOY == "%envId%"
%/project.environments%
```

In this example, we write the variable `MIA_CMS_IMAGE_NAME` only if `cmsImageName` is set in the company.

All sections between `%#project.environments%` and `%/project.environments%` will be written for `n` times, where `n` is the number of environments. So, inside the environment, you can use the environment specific fields.
For other possibilities, please check [mustache.js](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js) documentation.

You may want to write a file or a folder for every environment. To enable that, you can write the file name (or folder) in the template as `%envId%`, and it will be interpolated for every environment.
The interpolation data in those files includes the environments fields at the first level (as in `mustache.js` sections), with the project as a key for every environment.

## Project creation

Once you have provider, company, and template correctly configured, you are able to create a new project using the `Create project` button in the Home area of the Console.

![new-project-cards-headers](img/new-project-cards-headers.png)

The project creation is divided in three different steps.

### Step 1: **General**

In this step, you are required to insert the general information about your new project:

* **Company** (*required*): you are required to select, from a list of pre-configured companies, your company, which enables you to keep the same configuration for different projects;
* **Project name** (*required*): the name of your project, which will be shown in the project card in the Home section of the Console;
* **Description**: the description of your project, which will be shown in the project card in the Home section of the Console.
  
![create-project1](img/create-project1.png)

### Step 2: **Repository**

In this step, it is indicated the location of your new project and you have to choose its template:

* **Git Provider**: this field represents the provider ID used by your chosen company (e.g. *gitlab*, *github*, *azure-devops*, *bitbucket*);
* **Git repo path**: this is the path, calculated from project name and company, where the configuration will be saved on the Git provider. It specifies the location of your project on the Git provider website;
* **Visibility**: the visibility states the status of your project once it will be saved on the Git provider. If it is `internal`, all the internal users of the Git provider instance can see the project. If it is `private`, only who has access to the repository can see the project;
* **Template** (*required*): you have to select, from a list of pre-configured templates, your template, which enables you to use pre-filled configurations for your project.

:::tip
If you are using the PaaS Mia-Platform Console, two main templates are available: one with all the core services, and the other which is similar, but without CMS. More information about how to use them at [the bottom of this page](#setup-paas-templates).
:::

![create-project2](img/create-project2.png)

### Step 3: **Environments**

In this step, an overview of the configuration of your project environments is presented. This section is entirely read-only, since the information displayed are retrieved from the selected company and, therefore, they are already configured and not editable:

* **Environment name**: the name given to your environment;
* **Environment ID**: the human-readable ID set to your environment;
* **Host**: the host which exposes documentation and APIs;
* **Backoffice Host**: the host which exposes CMS and backoffice APIs;
* **Cluster Host**: the IP of the Kubernetes cluster where the project will be deployed;
* **Namespace**: the namespace taken from Kubernetes;
* **Description**: the description of your environment.

Moreover, a label **Production** is displayed next to the title of the dropdown card in case the corresponding environment is labeled as a production environment.

![create-project3](img/create-project3.png)

For security reasons, and since after this step the project will be effectively created, when trying to proceed further a confirmation modal is displayed. By clicking on *Create*, the project will be irreversibly generated.

![create-project-modal](img/create-project-modal.png)

At the end of the process, your project will be visible in the Home section of your Console.

Once your project has been created, you will be redirected on the Project Settings area of your new project, where you can see your environments and a list of environment variables:

* Some variables are pre-filled from project or company information (like *CMS_IMAGE_NAME*, *CRUD_LIMIT_CONSTRAINT_ENABLED*, and *LOG_LEVEL*). Other variables are not pre-filled (such as *NOTIFICATIONS_COLLECTION_ROUTES* and *NOTIFICATIONS_SERVICE_PATH*);
* All variables are mandatory, except  *CRUD_LIMIT_CONSTRAINT_ENABLED*, *NOTIFICATIONS_SERVICE_PATH*, and *NOTIFICATIONS_COLLECTION_ROUTES*: you have to manually configure all the variables that are mandatory and not pre-filled like *MONGODB_SHORT_URL*, *MONGODB_URL*, and *REDIS_HOSTS*.

These environment variables are saved on the Git provider.

The Console automatically tries to create the namespace for each environment in the project, and if the creation is successful it also sets the following labels in the namespace:

Label|Value
-|-
`mia-platform.eu/company`|`tenantId`
`mia-platform.eu/environment`|`envId`
`mia-platform.eu/project`|`projectId`

After the project creation phase, you have to commit and deploy your new project to effectively conclude the process.

#### A note about Project Metrics

When a production environment is defined for a project, a preview of its **Kubernetes Metrics** will be rendered inside the related card in the Home Page. These metrics will show the following information:

* Environment name;
* Status (healthy, down);
* Number of pods up and running;
* CPU usage;
* RAM usage.

## Customize the project with additional information (Optional)

In order to improve the governance of your project, you may want to add additional details such as:

* `technologies`: the list of technologies used in the project codebase;
* `projectOwner` and `teamContact`: the name and contact of the project owner;
* `color`: a custom color that can be used as an additional categorization, especially if a label has been already defined (e.g. you may decide within your organization that all projects flagged with a *gateway* are associated with the same color);
* `layerId`: a label which identifies a logical layer and can help to categorize projects in custom groups (e.g. *gateway* or *data-lake* are some samples of logical layer names that can be applied to a project);
The `layerId` must be equal to one of the layer names inside the `logicalScopeLayers` property of the related **tenant** object. When the layer is found within the company, the project model is enriched with the `logicalScopeLayers` property according to the values found;
* `logicalScopeLayers`: an array of objects shaped as follows:
  * **name**: identifies the name of the logical layer;
  * **order**: identifies the numerical order of the layer, in order to display it according to the sorting defined by the user.

`layerId` and `logicalScopeLayers` are mutually exclusive, since the former must be used when a `tenantId` is specified for the project, while the latter must not.

### CMS Configurations

All the above properties can be defined via CMS after a project has been created, because they only provide extra information that will be eventually rendered in the Home Page of the Console.

Let's say we have created a project as follows:

```json
{
    "_id": "ObjectId(...)",
    "name": "frontend gateway",
    "projectId": "frontend-gateway",
    "configurationGitPath": "git-config-path",
    "repositoryUrl": "http://example.repository/git-config-path",
    "tenantId": "mia-platform"
}
```

To configure all the extra details to a project, just add the `info`, `layerId`/`logicalScopeLayers`, and the `color` properties via the CMS Interface.

### Project Information

To add extra info about `projectOwner`, `teamContact`, and `technologies` for a single project, you can simply edit the *Information* field:

```json
{
    "projectOwner": "John Smith",
    "teamContact": "j.smith@email.it ",
    "technologies": [
        "java",
        "node"
    ]
}
```

### Custom Color

To edit the custom `color` associated with a project, just change the value in the *Project Color* field:

![color-project-cms](img/color-project-cms.png)

### Layer Identifier (layerId)

If the project has a `tenantId` that includes a definition for its `logicalScopeLayers`, then the *Layer Identifier* field can be defined by simply specifying a layer name that exists in the related `logicalScopeLayers`:

![layerId-project-cms](img/layerId-project-cms.png)

### Logical scope layer (logicalScopeLayers)

Alternatively to the above step, if the project isn't under a `tenantId`, then `logicalScopeLayers` can be defined directly by editing the *Logical Scope Layer* field:

At the end of the configuration, on the backend side, the project will have the following data structure:

### Sample of project data structure with tenantId

```json
{
    "_id": "ObjectId(...)",
    "name": "frontend gateway",
    "projectId": "frontend-gateway",
    "configurationGitPath": "git-congif-path",
    "repositoryUrl": "http://example.repository/git-config-path",
    "tenantId": "mia-platform",
    "info": {
      "projectOwner": "John Smith",
      "teamContact": "john.smith@email.com",
      "technologies": ["javascript", "dockerfile", "shell"]
    },
    "layerId": "gateway",
    "color": "green"
  }
```

### Sample of project data structure without tenantId

```json
{
    "_id": "ObjectId(...)",
    "name": "frontend gateway",
    "projectId": "frontend-gateway",
    "configurationGitPath": "git-congif-path",
    "repositoryUrl": "http://example.repository/git-config-path",
    "info": {
      "projectOwner": "John Smith",
      "teamContact": "john.smith@email.com",
      "technologies": ["javascript", "dockerfile", "shell"]
    },
    "logicalScopeLayers": [{"name": "gateway", "order": 1}],
    "color": "green"
  }
```

When loading the Home Page of the Console, the project `Frontend Gateway` will be rendered accordingly:

### Customize your cluster

It is possible to add a proxy configuration in cluster configuration in environments.
A configuration example:

```json
{
  "environments": [
    {
      "cluster": {
        "proxy": {
          "url": "http://url-to-proxy/"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Proxy URL supports `http`, `https`, and basic auth inside proxy URL. For example, an URL with basic auth would be like `https://username:password@url-to-proxy/`. <!--- gitleaks:allow -->

### Final Step: **Activate CRUD**

To activate the CRUD for your project, you can contact your Mia-Platform's responsible for creating a connection with MongoDB.

### Setup PaaS templates

If you are using the PaaS Console, the following templates are available:

* `Mia-Platform Multitenant with Traefik`: it contains all services used by the Console (i.e. `crud-service`, `api-portal`, `swagger-aggregator`, `microservice-gateway`, `authorization-service`, `api-gateway`, `cms-site`, `cms-backend`, `v1-adapter`, `export-service`, `auth0-client`, and `oauth-login-site`) with a correct configuration;
* `Mia-Platform Multitenant Without CMS`: it contains all services except the CMS-related ones, i.e. `cms-site`, `cms-backend`, `v1-adapter`, `export-service`, `auth0-client`, and `oauth-login-site`.

A project created with one of these templates is almost ready to use, but some configuration is required for all its services to work correctly:

1. For the `crud-service` to be deployed and work correctly, you need a value for the environment variable `MONGODB_URL`. When the project is first created, its value is an empty string. To fix that, go to Environments section, check out the Environment Variables table, and either change its value, or delete it if you want to inherit this value. This needs to be done for all the environments you are interested in.
2. For `auth0-client` service to be deployed and work correctly, you need to setup various environment variables, as specified in its configuration. You can find the configuration in the Design Area, Advanced Section, `auth0-client` option, `config.js` file. More on the configuration of the `auth0-client` [here](../../runtime_suite/auth0-client/configuration).

### Configure Security Features

From the CMS page it is possible to employ a set of security features in order to enrich the configuration of your project.

Those features are all set to `true` by default and can be switched off for testing or to account for compatibility issues, by managing the properties of the `securityFeatures` key.

```json
{
  seccompProfile: { type: 'boolean' },
  appArmor: { type: 'boolean' },
  hostProperties: { type: 'boolean' },
  privilegedPod: { type: 'boolean' }
}
```

Head over to the [security features documentation](../api-console/api-design/security) to better understand which capabilities are implemented.
