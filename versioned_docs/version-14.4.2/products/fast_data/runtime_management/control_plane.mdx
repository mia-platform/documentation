Fast Data Control Plane allows to:

* manage Fast Data Runtimes, in particular groups them in Runtime Views;
* keep track of the state of the different pipelines belonging to all the managed runtimes;
* receive user interactions through Control Plane, and to update pipeline state accordingly;
* receive feedbacks from the Control Plane Operators that registered to this specific Control Plane instance;

In the following paragraphs is described Control Plane service configuration and communication interfaces.

## Configuration

Configuration of _Control Plane_ is a straightforward process that involves setting up a ConfigMap and specifying essential environment variables.

### Environment Variables

Control Plane service can be customized using the following environment variables:

| Name                                      | Required | Description                                                                                                                       | Default Value                            |
|-------------------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `HTTP_PORT`                               | -        | This variable determines the TCP port where the **HTTP controller** binds its listener                                            | 3000                                     |
| `GRPC_PORT`                               | -        | This variable determines the TCP port where the **gRPC controller** binds its listener                                            | 50051                                    |
| `LOG_LEVEL`                               | -        | Specify the centralized application log level, choosing from options such as `debug`, `error`, `info`, `trace` or `warn`          | `info`                                   |
| `FD_CONTROL_PLANE_CONFIGURATION_FILEPATH` | -        | Set the location of the configuration file                                                                                        | `~/.fd/control_plane/configuration.json` |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`             | -        | The URL to a GRPC endpoint of an OpenTelemetry Collector.<br/>Specifying this value enables the support for OpenTelemetry tracing |                                          |

### Config Map

The configuration of the service is handled by a JSON file whose location is defined by the `FD_CONTROL_PLANE_CONFIGURATION_FILEPATH`. When instantiating
[Control Plane application](/runtime-components/applications/fast-data-control-plane/10_overview.md) from Marketplace, Control Plane service configuration is generated with
a dedicated Config Map, named `control-plane-configuration`.  
This file contains a template configuration that should help in configuring the service.

<SchemaViewer schema={ControlPlaneSchema} />

#### Feedback Cache

:::info
Currently only [Redis](https://redis.io/) is supported as feedback cache for storing relevant data, such as current pipelines state.
:::

Control Plane receive feedbacks from all the registered Control Plane Operators, which may vary in the number depending on how many Fast Data Runtimes are selected for management.
In order to decouple the internal feedback flow from the live updates stream opened towards the Control Plane UI and to support service replication, Control Plane service leverages
an external cache to store those Fast Data Runtime states.  
Cache details can be declared in the configuration file under the `cache.configuration` property, whose main fields are:

- `url` &rarr; the connection string to your Redis instance;

An example of cache configuration can be seen below:

```json
{
  "cache": {
    "type": "redis",
    "configuration": {
      "url": "redis://<redis-instance-address>:6379"
    }
  },
  // ...other control plane configurations
}
```

:::tip
The following properties support [secret resolution](/products/fast_data/configuration/secrets_resolution.md):
- `cache.configuration.url`
:::

:::note
When instantiating Fast Data Control Plane application, a small Redis instance is added to your project, ready for supporting Control Plane operator. In case you would like
to adopt your own Redis instance, please update the generated configuration accordingly.
:::

#### Persistence Layer

:::info
Currently only [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com/) is supported as persistence layer for storing relevant data.
:::

:::caution
The MongoDB database selected for storing Control Plane data **must be configured to have [`replicaSet` enabled](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/replication/)**, since
Control Plane exploits features that can be used only when a `replicaSet` is available.
:::

In order to carry out all its operations, Control Plane requires a _persistence layer_ where relevant information are stored. In particular,
it stores the next desired state of each Fast Data Runtime, which the system needs to reconcile with, alongside details regarding [Runtime Views](/products/fast_data/runtime_management/overview.mdx#runtime-view)
and [Pipelines](/products/fast_data/runtime_management/overview.mdx#pipeline) components.

This configuration can be set under the `persistence.configuration` key of the configuration file. The main properties are:

- `url` &rarr; the connection string to your MongoDB instance with `replicaSet` enabled;
- `database` &rarr; the database name where to search for the  collections relevant to Control Plane service. Please notice that setting this property will **override** the database
name potentially set in the connection string;

An example of persistence configuration can be seen below:

```json
{
  // ...other control plane configurations
  "persistence": {
    "type": "mongodb",
    "configuration": {
      "url": "mongodb://<server>:27017/<default-database>?replicaSet=local",
      "database": "<data-fabric-database-name>"
    }
  },
  // ...other control plane configurations
}
```

:::tip
The following properties support [secret resolution](/products/fast_data/configuration/secrets_resolution.md):
- `persistence.configuration.url`
- `persistence.configuration.database`
:::

#### Service Settings

Additionally, the Control Plane service itself has a set of properties for changing its behavior. Here are listed the available ones within `settings` properties:

- `apiPrefix` &rarr; the base path applied to all the exposed routes. It defaults to `/`;
- `auditUserHeader` &rarr; specifies in which HTTP header can be found the user identifier set by the authentication system. The value of this header will be employed to correlate requests stored by
the auditing system with the user that performed them. When using Mia-Platform Authentication and Authorization services this property can be set to `miauserid`.  
In case it is not set the auditing system does not correlate users with requests;

Here can be found a configuration example:

```json
{
  // ...other control plane configurations
  "settings": {
    "apiPrefix": "/",
    "auditUserHeader": "miauserid"
  }
}
```

### Enable gRPC communications

Control Plane main service **must** be reachable through [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) from Control Plane Operators deployed in other namespaces either _internally_, within your K8s cluster, or _externally_ from outside.
In this manner Control Plane Operators can register themselves on the main Control Plane instance and establish a channel where desired pipelines states
are received and Fast Data Runtimes states are sent back.

Thus, it is necessary to advertise the port where the gRPC controller is exposed by Control Plane service, which by default is the `50051`. This operation can be achieved by adding the proper port
to the list of [_Container Ports_](/products/console/api-console/api-design/microservice-container-ports.md) that can be found in the Console Design area, under the specific microservice resource. The expected list, based on default configuration, is shown below in the image.

![Control Plane microservice ports](./img/control_plane_ports.png)

:::tip
When instantiating Fast Data Control Plane application, _Container Ports_ are pre-filled with all the needed ports using their default value.  
In case either the HTTP or the gRPC port chosen through [environment variables](#environment-variables) has been edited, please change the _Container Ports_ accordingly.
:::

#### Reach Control Plane from within your cluster

When connecting to Control Plane service from another namespace of your cluster, depending on your additional K8s rules and policies, it shouldn't be
necessary to apply any further configuration. If in doubt, please contact your K8s cluster administrator to learn whether additional communication restrictions were put in place.

#### Reach Control Plane from outside your cluster

In case Control Plane service should be configured to be reachable from outside your cluster, for example because your Fast Data Control Plane application is located in a cluster
different from the one where Fast Data Runtimes are deployed, a few extra advanced configuration steps are necessary. These are listed here:

- **Introduce further Envoy [`cluster`](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/config/cluster/v3/cluster.proto) to expose the gRPC port of Control Plane service through the API Gateway.**  
  This can be obtained by opening your Mia-Platform Console Project and selecting the Advanced tab from the Design area's sidebar. 
  
  :::info
  This step is necessary if you are using Mia-Platform Console versions lower than v13.5.1. Otherwise, you can skip the modification to the file `api-gateway-envoy/clusters.yaml` here described.
  :::
  
  Within this area of Console it is possible
  to extend Envoy API Gateway default configuration, by editing the file `api-gateway-envoy/clusters.yaml` with the following content:

  ```yaml title=api-gateway-envoy/clusters.yaml
  - "@type": type.googleapis.com/envoy.config.cluster.v3.Cluster
    name: control-plane
    connect_timeout: 30s
    http2_protocol_options:
      max_concurrent_streams: 100
    type: LOGICAL_DNS
    lb_policy: ROUND_ROBIN
    load_assignment:
      cluster_name: control-plane
      endpoints:
      - lb_endpoints:
        - endpoint:
          address:
            socket_address:
              address: 'control-plane'
              port_value: 50051
- **Expose new subdomain from which Control Plane gets accessible** (assuming [`traefik`](https://traefik.io/traefik/) is employed as ingress controller)   
  In order to carry out this operation you first need to have access to the repository of the Console Project where Control Plane application has been configured.
  Within the project repository there is a folder named `overlays`, which should contains a folder for each environment available for the project.  
  For each of the environment of interest, open the folder and edit the `default.ingressroute.yml` by adding the following record under the `spec.routes` array:

  ```yaml
  - match: Host(`grpc-<PROJECT_DOMAIN>`)
    middlewares:
      - name: "ingress-controller-hsts-headers"
        namespace: mia-platform
    kind: Rule
    services:
      - name: api-gateway
        port: 50051
        scheme: h2c
        passHostHeader: true
  ```
  where `<PROJECT_DOMAIN>` should be replaced with the project's domain for currently selected environment. An example could be `my-cool-project.test.my-domain.com`.


## Endpoints

When connecting internally to Control Plane service, it is not necessary to publicly expose any endpoint, since all the Control Plane routes can be reached internally
or via Fabric BFF.

In case the service must be reached from outside the cluster, the endpoints listed in the table below should be _defined in Console_ and assigned to Control Plane service.
These endpoints are necessary to allow gRPC Control Plane Operator requests to reach Control Plane from outside the K8s cluster.

| Endpoint                                    | Rewrite Base Path                           | Microservice    | Container Port |
|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------|

| `/grpc.reflection.v1alpha.ServerReflection` | `/grpc.reflection.v1alpha.ServerReflection` | `control-plane` |     `50051`    |
| `/control_plane_fabric.RuntimeManagement`   | `/control_plane_fabric.RuntimeManagement`   | `control-plane` |     `50051`    |                        
| `/control_plane_fabric.ControlPlane`        | `/control_plane_fabric.ControlPlane`        | `control-plane` |     `50051`    |

Also, in the `Advanced Section` of each endpoint, be sure that the _Use DownStream Protocol option_ is set to `true`.

### Routes

Here are described which routes Control Plane service serves

## Migration Guides

Here are the migration steps to perform between each version of the service.

### From 0.1.x to 0.3.0

Control Plane changes the activation default behavior of pipelines from 'pause' to 'resume'. This
means that when a pipeline is first added it receives the command to 'resume' all its workloads.
The behavior is not suitable to release control to Control Plane from production envirnments where
Fast Data is currently running.

If updating from version 0.1.x it is recommended to update the runtime current activation status by either:

- recreting the runtime
- use the api-portal/swagger and invoke a post on `<prefix>/fast-data/control` with body
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "resume",
  "params": {
    "runtime": "<ID OF THE RUNTIME>"
  }
}
```
