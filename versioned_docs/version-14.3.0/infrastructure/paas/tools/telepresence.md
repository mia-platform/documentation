Mia-Platform PaaS provides you with [Telepresence](https://www.telepresence.io) on its Kubernetes cluster to enable debugging and troubleshooting. With Telepresence, you can gain real-time insights into your applications' behavior, ensuring a smooth development experience.  

Telepresence is a powerful tool that allows you to connect your local development environment directly to our Kubernetes cluster, bridging the gap between local testing and production. To enable this service, kindly request its activation through our [Customer Portal](https://makeitapp.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/21). Once enabled, you can begin using Telepresence to accelerate your debugging and troubleshooting workflows.
